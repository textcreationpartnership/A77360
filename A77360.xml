         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Buy them therefore with what ſpeed thou canſt, and read them over di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, it will be a good bargain for thy Soul, and one of the Richeſt Commodities that ever thou metteſt with at ſo cheap a Rate. It is put into ſo ſmall a Letter and Bulk, purpoſely for thy bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accommodation, and that not only in the eaſe of thy Purſe, but principally that thou mayeſt make it, as well thy Pocket, as thy Hearts Companion, where e're thou goeſt. </p>

               <p>Secondly, As for the concernment of Chriſt: By his going to the Father, he was exalted, and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (as Mediatour I ſpeak.)</p>

                  </gap> ask yet, what was the Entertainment that he had when he came unto the Father.</p>
               <p>Why, it was an Entertainment ſuitable to <hi>ſuch a Father,</hi>—and to <hi>ſuch a Son.</hi> When that great Sinner, the Prodigall, returned unto his Father, <hi>his Father fell upon his neck, and kiſſed him.</hi> Bring out the Robes, kill the Fatted Calf,, bring out the Ring: And if <hi>ſuch</hi> an entertainment for a <hi>Prodigall</hi> Son, what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment then for the <hi>Naturall</hi> Son of God, the <hi>obedient</hi> Son of God, that had been upon his Father's great concernment in the world? <hi>Great was this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment ſurely,</hi> beyond all my expreſſion. But now more particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="3">3. No ſooner did he come unto the Father, but he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:171186:6"/> was annointed with <hi>a new and freſh Annointing,</hi> with the <hi>oyle of gladneſſe above all his fellows:</hi> For as <hi>David</hi> (the Type) had a double Annointing, one by the hand of <hi>Samuel,</hi> after which he was thruſt out into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, and another at the day of his Coronation, ſo Chriſt Typified had a double Annointing, one upon his Incarnation, in which reſpects he ſaith, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, and he hath annointed me to preach,</hi> —and another upon his Coronation, when he was crowned with Glory and honour. And therefore in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>he is annointed twith the oyle of gladneſſe above his fellows,</hi> comes in upon his exaltation. And</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p>But 2ly. What advancement had he upon his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Father?</p>
               <p>Why, great was his advancement as Mediatour.</p>

Thus for the Son's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What matter is there of rejoycing by Chriſt's going to the Father, in reference to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's concernment?</p>
               <p>Much; ſaith Chriſt in <hi>John</hi> 14.13. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</hi> That will I do; I am now going from you, and if ye ask the Father in my name, that will I do, —why? not that the <hi>Son</hi> may be glorified onely, but that the <hi>Father</hi> may be glorified.</p>
               <p>Look when the great Promiſe of the Father is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, then is the Father glorified. What's the great Promiſe of the Father? <hi>Acts</hi> 1.

               <p>And to ſay no more in it but this: Look, when the <hi>great d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, How may it appear, that it is our wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> own debaſement, or preſent loſſe?</p>
               <p>Why you ſee what our Saviour ſaith here, <hi>If ye lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, ye would rejoyce, becauſe I go unto the Father, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is greater than I.</hi> You loſe by my going you think; and indeed in ſome reſpects you do. But however it is your duty to rejoyce, becauſe it is for my <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall Exaltment:</hi> And you know what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in another caſe. Some Preach Chriſt out of envy, and out of contention, and to adde affliction to my bonds; but however, ſaith he, Chriſt is preached, <hi>Chriſt is exalted, and therein I will rejoyce:</hi> I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, though I be debaſed, ſo Chriſt may be exalted, I rejoyce.</p>
               <p>If that we are to <hi>Praiſe</hi> God for the Exaltment of Chriſt, then we are to rejoyce therein; for <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Rejoycing</hi> go together in Scripture. Now, though I cannot praiſe God, and be thankfull that God loves me, I may praiſe God for this, that the Father loves Chriſt, and be thankfull for his love and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to Chriſt. Chriſt praiſed God for our glory and happineſſe, though to his own debaſement, why
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:171186:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhould not we praiſe God for his Exaltment, though it be to our debaſement?</p>
               <p>If I am to mourn for ſin, becauſe it is a diſhonour to God, though the ſin be to my <hi>own profit,</hi> then I am to praiſe God and Chriſt for his Glory, though it may be in ſome reſpects to <hi>my prejudice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t beſides this, the more <hi>Communicative</hi> any good is, the more we may, and ſhould rejoyce therein. There is abundance of light in the Sun, but if the Sun be not <hi>up, and aſcended,</hi> it cannot give light unto all the world: So now, though there be light in Chriſt, able to enlighten all the world, yet if this Sun be not up, he cannot give light to all the world: but being now <hi>Aſcended,</hi> he is able to give forth his beams of light unto all the world.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay; How may it appear, that Chriſt will be as <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>communicative</hi> in his love unto us now in heaven, as he would have been had he been here on earth.</p>
               <p>You know what he ſaid when he was here on earth, <hi>And let him that is athirſt come.</hi> John 7.37. <hi>In the last day, the great day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cryed, ſaying; If any man thirſt, let him come unto me, and drink.</hi> —Now he is in heaven, look into the Book of the Revelation, which he ſpeaks from heaven, he ſpeaks more than that, <hi>And let him that is athirſt come,</hi> there's that, <hi>And whoſoever will, let him take of the water of life freely,</hi> here's more now he is in heaven.</p>
               <p>And I pray, when did our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, waſh his Diſciples feet? Give the glorious teſtimony of his condeſcending love unto his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> when he was going to the Father? <hi>Jeſus knowing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God: he aroſe from Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and laid aſide his Garments, and took a Towel and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:171186:9"/> girded himſelf.</hi> Knowing that all power was given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand, he gives that reaſon: He did thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend in this way of love, knowing that all power was given into his hand.</p>
               <p>Now that he is in heaven, all power is given into his hand, and therefore now certainly he will be as gracious, and communicative in his love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as if he had been here on earth; and rather o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above. Surely therefore it is our work and our duty, to rejoyce in this Exaltment of Chriſt, though in ſome reſpects it may be to our debaſement, or preſent loſſe. But then</p>
               <p>Thirdly, How ſhall we do this?</p>
               <p>Why, true love to the Perſon of Chriſt will enable us to do this: It will enable us to rejoyce in the <hi>Perſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall Exaltment</hi> of Chriſt, though it may be to our own <hi>preſent loſſe</hi> and abaſement. —It is a ſweet thing to the Lover, to ſuffer for the Perſon loved: that is, <hi>where love fixt upon the Perſon,</hi> and not upon the benefits, If love be fixt upon the benefit, it is not ſo, but if upon the perſon, it is ſo: So if our love be fixt upon the Perſon of Chriſt, this love will enable us to rejoyce in the Exaltment of Chriſt, though it be in our own debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Chriſt rejoyced in our Exaltment, though it was to his own debaſement, —why? becauſe he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our perſons, <hi>who loved us, and gave himſelf for us,</hi> So that true love unto the Perſon of Chriſt, will make us rejoyce in his Exaltment, though it may be to our own preſent debaſement,</p>
               <p>You will ſay then, How few are there, that do love Chriſt indeed: <hi>Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They may be wanting in the <hi>manner</hi> of their love to Chriſt's Perſon.</p>
               <p>They may be wanting in the <hi>meaſure</hi> of their love to Chriſt's Perſon.</p>

                  <hi>If ye loved me,</hi> ſaith he, and yet they left all to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him: poſſibly then, the beſt Diſciples of Chriſt, the beſt men may be wanting in their love to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt. To make this out a little to you.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               </p>
               <p>This knowledge of Chriſt crucified, is not a bare knowledge of Chriſt crucified in the hiſtory; but it is a ſerious looking into the myſtery thereof.

And ſo a man is ſaid to know Chriſt crucified, when he doth underſtand and know the mind and will of God the Father, in that great myſtery, and doth approve thereof.</p>
               <p>In Scripture phraſe again, a man is ſaid to know God, or know Chriſt, when he doth believe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in Chriſt: ſo, <hi>This is life eternall, to know thee, and him whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> that is, to believe, <hi>knowing</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put for <hi>believing.</hi>

               <p>And in Scripture phraſe a man is ſaid to know, and to know Chriſt, when the power, and the efficacy of the Death of Chriſt is ſhed abroad into his heart, and upon his life; and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking to the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> ſaith, <hi>I account all things droſſe for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt, that I may be conformed to his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</hi> So that I ſay, look when a man doth not onely underſtand, but doth ſeriouſly look into, and conſider this great myſtery of Chriſt crucified, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thereof, reſt and repoſe upon this crucified Chriſt, having the power and efficacy of his Death ſhed abroad into his heart and life, then he is ſaid for to know Chriſt crucified truly and effectually.

               <p>Why if it be the work, and great work of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel, to Preach Chriſt crucified; then it is our work, our great work, to know Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

               <p n="2">2. Look what that is, that all the Ceremonies, Sacrifices, and Types of the Old Teſtament, and all the Ordinances of the New Teſtament do hold forth, that are we to know eſpecially. Now what do all the

And as for the perſonall excellencies, and fulneſſe of Chriſt, though thoſe excellencies do draw out your love unto Chriſt, yet it is a crucified Chriſt that doth draw out your Faith: The perſonall excellency of Chriſt makes him a <hi>fit ſubject</hi> for you to reſt on, but it is Chriſt crucified that you <hi>build and lay the weight of your ſoul upon.</hi> The brazen Serpent did not cure the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by virtue of it's excellent metall, <hi>but as lift up;</hi> ſo, ſaith Chriſt, ſhall the Son of man be lift up on the Croſſe, and as lift up on the Croſſe he is the object of our Faith: and though our graces are, and may be a <hi>good help</hi> to confirm our faith of <hi>aſſurance,</hi> yet they are not the object of our faith of <hi>reliance:</hi> for God doth therefore ſometimes put the <hi>ſentence of death upon our graces,</hi> that we may not truſt to, or reſt on them: Chriſt and Chriſt alone, and that as dying and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is the object of our faith. And it is not with this object as it is with other objects: take another object, and though it be never ſo cleary ſpread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the organ or faculty, yet it cannot cauſe, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Act.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes very well; for the Apoſtle doth not there ſpeak of the knowledge of Chriſt crucified, neither doth he ſay, that we ſhould not know the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and fleſh of Chriſt ſtill: there have been indeed a generation of men, (and ſtill are) who thought, that when Chriſt died, roſe, and aſcended, his body was ſwallowed up of his Deity, and that he hath now no body, but is all ſpirit: but the Apoſtle ſpeaks the contrary; for, ſays he to the <hi>Philippians, Who ſhall change our vile body, that it ſhall be like to his glorious body:</hi> Chriſt then, though in heaven, hath a body ſtill, and this we are ſtill to know. And in this Verſe he ſaith, <hi>Henceforth know we no man after the fleſh,</hi> are we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to think, that men have no bodies of fleſh here on earth? the ſame is ſaid of Chriſt, that therefore
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:171186:18"/> cannot be the meaning of theſe words: but we are not to know Chriſt after the fleſh, that is (ſay ſome) upon any fleſhly or carnall account, or in any fleſhly or carnall manner; but I rather think, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here ſpeaketh in reference to the Jews: times were, when we thought, that the Meſſiah, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him, did belong to the Jews onely; but now (ſaith he) we know, that <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> not the Jews onely, but the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alſo, ver. 19. and that Chriſt did not die onely for the Jews, but for the Gentiles; and <hi>he died for all, that they which live ſhould not live unto themſelves, but unto him that died for them, and roſe again; wherefore</hi> (ſee how it comes in) <hi>henceforth know we no man after the fleſh; though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more, therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature,</hi> whether he be a Jew or a Gentile, 'tis all one to us whatſoever he be, if he be in Chriſt he is a new creature, <hi>wherefore now know we no man after the fleſh, no not Chriſt himſelf,</hi> upon any ſuch Jewiſh and reſtrained account, for <hi>he died for all,</hi> one as well as another, <hi>wherefore henceforth know we no man after the fleſh, no not Chriſt himſelf.</hi> And thus this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture being opened, the one place is not contrary, but a light to the other. And ſo much in anſwer to that objection, and for the ſecond thing, namely, that it is our great work and buſineſſe, to know Chriſt crucified.</p>

               <p n="6">6. By your knowledg of Chriſt crucified, you ſhall grow in Grace, in one Grace as well as in another; <hi>grow in Aſſurance, and yet in Repentance; grow in Repentance, and yet in Aſſurance.</hi> The ſight of Chriſt crucified is a friend unto your Repentance, and a friend unto your Aſſurance. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>Grow in grace,</hi> not in this or that Grace, but Grace in the general: <hi>Grow in Grace, and in the knowledg of Chriſt:</hi> ſo that the knowledge of Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is that whereby you ſhall grow in one grace as well as in another.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Thereby alſo your hearts ſhall be eſtabliſhed in oppoſition to all ſufferings and afflictions. It will <hi>incourage</hi> you to ſuffer, and it will <hi>inable</hi> you to ſuffer. <hi>Nichodemus</hi> came by Night when he firſt came to Chriſt; but after he had ſeen Chriſt upon
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:171186:24"/> the Croſs, and ſeen the ſufferings of Chriſt, <hi>how boldly did he own Chriſt then!</hi> The ſight of a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, will both <hi>incourage</hi> to ſuffer, and <hi>inable</hi> to ſuffer. All our ſufferings are either <hi>outward</hi> or <hi>inward:</hi> — If my ſufferings and afflictions be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the ſight of a ſuffering Chriſt will make me ſuffer: — If my afflictions be inward and ſpiritual, what is there that will quiet the Conſcience of a poor trembling ſoul, but Chriſt crucified? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (I ſay) you ſhall be eſtabliſhed in oppoſition unto all your ſufferings and afflictions, inward and outward.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Thereby alſo you ſhall have boldneſs in all your addreſſes unto God the Father: <hi>Wherefore,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Let us come with boldneſs to the Throne of Grace,</hi>— Why? <hi>For we have an High-Prieſt:</hi> An High-Prieſt, there is the ſufferings of Chriſt; Thereby you have boldneſs in all your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to God the Father.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Thereby, even by the knowledge of Chriſt crucified, you ſhall be poſſeſt of Chriſt. You know many things, and yet you do not poſſeſs them by your knowledge of them: <hi>But know Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and you are poſſeſt of Chriſt.</hi> Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>My little Children, of whom I travel in birth again, until Chriſt be formed in you.</hi> Chriſt formed in you, — that is, till the knowledge of Chriſt be formed in you. The knowledge of Chriſt brings one into the poſſeſsion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Yea thereby you ſhall be furniſhed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for every good word and work. — For, what is the death and ſuffering of Chriſt but <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina virtutum,</hi> the Shop of Vertues? — Do you want Faith? Chriſt crucified is the Object of your
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:171186:24"/> Faith, and the Cauſe of it, as you have heard. — Are you full of fears? Are you afraid becauſe of the Law, and the avenger of blood that is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you at the heels? Do but look upon Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and there you ſee the City of refuge. <hi>So many wounds in Chriſt, ſo many Cities of refuge.</hi> — Are you impatient and froward? why, the ſight of a patient Chriſt will make you patient. — Are you proud? The ſpirit of an humble Chriſt, a crucified Chriſt, will make you humble. If I have gallant and brave cloaths on, and go abroad and ſwagger with them, and a man comes and tells me, Sir, you owe for theſe cloaths, its enough to take down my Plumes. So now, Though a man be proud of this or that good thing, yet if he do but ſee Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, he ſhall there be told, that Chriſt hath paid for all; and this will take down his pride.— Do you complain of a hard heart? <hi>The ſight of a broken Chriſt will break your heart, or nothing will.</hi> So that the knowledge of Chriſt crucified is that that will furniſh you, and prepare you to every good word and work. And therefore, O friends, who would not labour to know Chriſt crucified? Let me ſpeak a little more.</p>
               <p n="11">11. This is the knowledge that is the <hi>ſoul-hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling knowledge:</hi> Other knowledge puffs up; but if you know Chriſt crucified, you may glory in your knowledge without pride: <hi>Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength, nor the learned man glory in his learning.</hi> If I glory in my wiſdom, I am proud; if I glory in my ſtrength, I am proud; but if I glory in that, that I know Chriſt crucified, the more I glory in Chriſt crucified, the more humble I am; That is a ſoul-humbling knowledge.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:171186:25"/>12. This is that knowledge which is the higheſt experimental knowledge in the World. A man may have the experience of his own ſins, yet be a wicked man: Oh, I have ſuch a proud heart, ſuch a vain heart, may he ſay; why? for his ſins are within him, and he may eaſily (though a wicked man) have experience of what is within him by nature: <hi>But to have experience of a crucified Chriſt is not by nature.</hi> This is the higheſt experience in the World, <hi>Chriſt in me the hope of glory;</hi> this is the moſt true experimental knowledge.</p>
               <p n="13">13. This is that knowledge that will make a man wiſe indeed: Other knowledge may make a man wiſe <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> to this or that thing, but the knowledge of Chriſt crucified doth make a man wiſe at large.</p>
               <p>And therefore I ſay, O what a bleſſed thing is it to know Chriſt crucified! and who would not labour to know Chriſt crucified in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</p>
               <p n="6">6. You will ſay then in the ſixth place, What ſhall we do to know Chriſt crucified in a right manner: For we have heard, men may live under the Goſpel, ſit upon the higheſt form of profeſsion, and yet not know Chriſt crucified in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: What ſhall we do then that we may know Chriſt crucified in a right manner? — Somthing I ſhall ſpeak to the manner, and ſomthing to the means.</p>
               <p>As to the manner: If you would know Chriſt crucified in a right manner, you muſt look upon him as the <hi>Great inſtitution and appoyntment of the Father.</hi> When God doth deal with us in a way of Inſtitutions, he hath not reſpect unto the ſtrength
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:171186:25"/> of the Means, or the worth of the Perſons. When God deals with us in a way of nature, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect had to the ſtrength of the Means, or the worth of the Perſon: As in Phyſick, God deals in a way of nature, there reſpect is had to the ſtrength of the Means. <hi>But when God deals with us in a way of inſtitution, there he hath neither reſpect to the ſtrength of means, nor to the worth of perſons.</hi> Now Jeſus Chriſt is the great Inſtitution of God the Father, and ſo if we would know him rightly, we muſt look upon him: For though the ſtung <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite</hi> was cured by the brazen Serpent, yet he was not cured by the brazen Serpent in regard of the mettle of the Serpent, <hi>but as it was an appointment, and as an inſtitution:</hi> So if a man would know Chriſt to purpoſe, he muſt know him, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as the great inſtitution and appointment of the Father, <hi>Him hath God the Father ſealed.</hi> And what is the reaſon that many go to and get no good by a crucified Chriſt, but becauſe they never did to this day look upon Chriſt crucified as the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would know Chriſt crucified in a right manner, you muſt then look upon him <hi>as ſent,</hi> you muſt look upon this crucified Chriſt <hi>under the miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Father.</hi> There are three great Miſſions that you read of in the New Teſtament. — There is the miſſion of Miniſters; they are ſent out to preach. — There is the miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>I will ſend the Comforter.</hi> — There is the miſſion of the Son ſent from the Father. <hi>Now the miſſion of Chriſt from the Father, is the original of all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And 2. for the Means, I ſhall ſpeak two or three things.</p>
               <p>If you would know Chriſt crucified in a right manner, for Means, Then go unto God the Father to create this knowledge of Chriſt crucified in you. <hi>All Light was at the firſt by a word of Creation,</hi> Let there be Light. And as in the old Creation, the Creation of the World, ſo in the new Creation, Let there be Light, Let there be Knowledge: <hi>God that commanded the Light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This light comes into the ſoul in a way of creation; go then to God to create this light.</p>
               <p>And be ſure that you <hi>ſet open all your Windows</hi> that the Light may come in. There are ſome ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and weak, who would fain have the Light to come into their Chambers, but they are afraid of the cold Air, and ſo dare not open their windows. So here, ſome would fain have more light and knowledge of Chriſt, but they are afraid of the cold, and ſo dare not open their windows to receive the light. But pray Friends, why ſhould we be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of new lights? for <hi>why ſhould there not be new Lights found out in the Firmament of the Scripture, as well as the Aſtrologers find out new Stars in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi> Be not afraid to ſet open your Windows for any light that God ſhall make known unto you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would know Chriſt crucified in a right way and manner, <hi>Then ſtudy much, think much upon this crucified Chriſt;</hi> meditate much, inſiſt and dwell much upon Chriſt crucified. It is not ſlight and ſuperficial thinking of Chriſt crucified that will bring in this knowledge. If I would know a

Now there are four times, wherein it will be good for you eſpecially to think of Chriſt crucified much. Four caſes. — Firſt, In caſe of ſome Revelation or Viſion that you may be under. When Chriſt was transfigured, and <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Another time or ſeaſon is, The time and caſe of ſpiritual pride. In caſe your heart be lifted up within you in reference unto any Priviledge, Gift, or performance, then is a fit time to think on a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Chriſt. The Diſciples were ſpeaking who ſhould be greateſt, <hi>That one might ſit on Chriſts right hand, and the other at his left hand;</hi> then ſaid Chriſt <hi>Are ye able to be baptized with the Baptiſme that I am baptiſed with, and to drink of the Cup that I ſhall drink of?</hi> The Son of man muſt ſuffer, ſaith he: He turns them about from thoſe thoughts to a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Chriſt; why, but to ſhew thus much, that when at any time our hearts are lift up upon any account, then is a fit time and ſeaſon to think on a Chriſt crucified. — 3. The time of diſſention and difference among profeſſors and Brethren, is a fit time and ſeaſon to think on a crucified Chriſt. When one Diſciple deſired to ſit at Chriſts right hand, and the other at his left, the reſt of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples took it ill, and all quarrelled one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Chriſt now tells them of his ſufferings; Is

               <p n="2">2. But then ſecondly, why is this Covenant cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a New Covenant?</p>
               <p>Not only becauſe it is an excellent Covenant, as in Scripture phraſe, excellent things are called <hi>New;</hi> a <hi>New Song, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:171186:33"/>
               <p>Nor onely becauſe it brings a new heart, which is promiſed in the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Nor onely becauſe it is alwayes freſh and green, and new, upon which account <hi>Auſtin</hi> thinks, that the commandment of <hi>Love</hi> is called a New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
               <p>Nor is it called <hi>New</hi> onely becauſe there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Covenant to ſucceed and follow, which is the reaſon in the 8th. of <hi>Heb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is called a New Covenant, in oppoſition to the Covenant that was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and with us in the ſtate of innocency; — and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Covenant which was made with the Jews in the time of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>New</hi> in oppoſition to the Covenant that was made with <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency; for then, though God out of free love and grace, was pleaſed to condeſcend to enter into Covenant with man, yet then God did deal with us in a way of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and of <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> and therefore there is mention made onely of the <hi>Threatning, In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye the death:</hi> But now God deals with us in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in a way of grace, and of great compaſsion; and therefore in this Covenant there is mention made onely of the <hi>Promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, 2. Though God did enter into Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo with us, and promiſed eternal life in <hi>Heaven;</hi> not eternal life <hi>in this World</hi> onely, as ſome would: For <hi>Hell</hi> was threatned in theſe words, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> and therefore Heaven and Salvation was promiſed on the contrary; yet I ſay (although God, when he entered into Covenant with us then,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:171186:34"/> did promiſe Heaven and Salvation) it was upon condition of our perſonal and perfect obedience, and therefore called a <hi>Covenant of works;</hi> But now our Covenant runs upon no ſuch terms.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then in that Covenant, acceptation began in the <hi>Work,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>Perſon,</hi> and therefore ſaith the Lord to <hi>Cain, If thou doeſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> ſpeaking to him as belonging to the Covenant of works: — But in the Covenant now made, the acceptation begins in the <hi>Perſon,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>Work,</hi> and therefore ſaith the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Abel,</hi> the Lord accepted <hi>Abel</hi> (his Perſon) and then his Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then alſo the Lord gave <hi>Adam,</hi> and us, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ability to ſtand, but he did not give a promiſe of perſeverance in ſtanding: But now the Lord doth, <hi>I will put my fear into your hearts, that you ſhall not depart from me,</hi> ſaith the Lord.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then in that Covenant, there was no room for repentance, no room for remiſsion: But as in a Court of meer Juſtice, the Queſtion is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man doth repent of his Fact or no, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I or No, hath ſuch a Fact been done? So by the Covenant of works, the firſt Covenant, there is no Queſtion whether a man doth repent or no, <hi>But whether the work were done, whether the ſin were done:</hi> But now in this Covenant, there is <hi>room both for repentance, and for remiſſion,</hi> (as by and by you ſhall hear.) And then</p>
               <p n="6">6. Though when God made that Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> and with us, <hi>the tree of Life</hi> might be ſome ſhaddow of Chriſt, yet <hi>then there was no Mediator, for there was no need,</hi> God and Man was not at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, and ſo no need of a Mediator: But in this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:171186:34"/> Covenant that is now ſtricken, there is a Mediator, a Mediator of the New Covenant. So that thus you ſee this Covenant is <hi>New,</hi> in oppoſition to the Covenant that was made with <hi>Adam</hi> and us in the ſtate of innocency.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, As it is New in oppoſition to the Covenant that was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works; ſo it is new alſo in oppoſition to the Covenant that was made with the Jews in the time of the Old Teſtament. For the clearing of this,</p>
               <p>Firſt of all we muſt inquire whether there be any difference between the Covenant made with the Jews in the day of the Old Teſtament, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with us now: — and in caſe there be, what is the difference, and wherein it lyes.</p>
               <p>And firſt, If you ask whether there be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould anſwer with Divines ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (wherein they ſpeak the truth) I muſt ſay, that the Covenant which God made with the Jews, was for ſubſtance the ſame, though different in admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; but give me leave to expreſs my own ſenſe in my own terms, thus,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is plain and clear, that the Jews that were ſaved in the time of the Old Teſtament, were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the ſame Covenant, that we now are ſaved by; for they were ſaved by the Covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo are we, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. Circumciſion then was the Seal of the Covenant; and what was Circumciſion, but <hi>a ſeal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith?</hi> The Ceremonies, Types and Sacrifices, <hi>did not belong to the Covenant of works, they were Types of Chriſt,</hi> and therefore it

               <p>Nor do I ſay, that Faith, Obedience and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are not required, but I ſay, Faith, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Repentance are required in the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as <hi>Duties,</hi> but <hi>not as Conditions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I ſay then, it is a free Covenant, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to all conditions to be performed by us; for when the Covenant of Grace is mentioned in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, where do you find any condition annexed to any thing that is there promiſed? — ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will remember your ſins no more:</hi> — Upon what condition? — none mentioned; — <hi>I will write my Law in your hearts;</hi> — Upon what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? — none mentioned; — <hi>You ſhall all know me from the greateſt to the leaſt, &amp;c.</hi> — Upon what condition? none mentioned. Where do you ever find the Covenant mentioned with a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>And plainly thus; if there were a Condition, the Condition muſt be a diſtinct thing from the thing promiſed. If I promiſe to go a journey with a man upon Condition he ſhall bear my charges; his bearing my charges, and my going the journey are diſtinct things. — Now what Condition then can there be? What Faith, Repentance or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? Why? theſe are all promiſed in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>therefore they cannot be the Condition; for the thing promiſed in the Covenant, and the Condition that we are to perform, muſt be diſtinct.</hi> I ſay, if there be a Condition, it muſt be diſtinct from the thing promiſed; but there is nothing that we can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:171186:38"/> but is promiſed in the Covenant; therefore there can be no Condition. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells us, that this Covenant is after the nature of that Covenant that God made with <hi>Noah,</hi> That the World ſhould be drowned no more; and that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> abſolute, and upon no Condition. <hi>Junius</hi> thinks, that upon this account, this Covenant of Grace i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> called a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>a Teſtament is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Condition.</hi> A man makes his laſt Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; and though now and then <hi>a man may hang a Condition upon a Rebellious Child,</hi> yet ordinarily, a man then gives, and he gives freely, without all Conditions; and ſo this Covenant is called a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: Why? becauſe no Condition is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us. That is the ſecond thing, it is a free Covenant in oppoſition to all Conditions to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As it is a free Covenant, in oppoſition to al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But now this Covenant of Grace is an everlaſting Covenant, <hi>ordered in all things and ſure,</hi> an everlaſting Covenant that cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And thus you ſee what kind of Covenant it is; It is a Covenant of Grace, in oppoſition to all works and worth in us; — a Free Covenant in oppoſition to all Conditions to be performed by us: — and an everlaſting Covenant: Lo, this is the Covenant that is ſtricken with the Children of Men.</p>

               <p>Firſt, This Covenant of Grace is not made or ſtricken with all the particular men in the world; A New Covenant will I make <hi>with the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> not with all the particular men in the world. If this New Covenant of Grace were made with all the particular men in the world, then all the particular men in the world ſhould have the Law of God written in their hearts, and ſhould all know God, and all have their ſins pardoned, for ſo ſaith the Covenant, by an abſolute promiſe which muſt be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>And <hi>upon this account it follows, that Chriſt did not dye for every particular man in the world,</hi> for Chriſt is the Mediator of the New Covenant; therefore <hi>if the New Covenant be not made with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular man, Chriſt did not dye for every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man;</hi> but the New Covenant is not made with all the particular men in the world, as you have heard.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As this New Covenant is not made with all the particular men in the world, ſo neither is it made with all that live under the Goſpel. Though <hi>Iſhmael</hi> lived in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, and ſo the skirt of the Covenant might be thrown over him, yet in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall <hi>thy Seed be called,</hi> ſaith God. A man may be in a Church, yet not of the Church; as a man may be in a houſe, and yet not of the houſe. This Covenant is not made with all particular men that live under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But who is it ſtricken with?</p>
               <p>Plainly thus; If the <hi>Law of the Goſpel be written
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:171186:39"/> in your hearts, ſo that it is natural for you to do the work of the Goſpel;</hi> as it is natural to an heathen to do the work of nature, becauſe the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is written in his heart; then is this Covenant made with you: for thus runs the Covenant, I will write my Law in your hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If that you are <hi>taught of God, having an holy inſtinct unto what is good.</hi> As the Bee being taught of God, finds the way home to the Hive by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct; and the Lamb being taught of God, find out his Dam amongſt a thouſand Sheep.

               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:171186:39"/>
               <p>And to ſay no more in it but this, If you be the Seed of Chriſt, then is this Covenant made with you, for it is made with Chriſt and his Seed; and if you be <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, then are you the Seed of Chriſt; for you may ſee how they go together in the third Chapter of the <hi>Galathians; Now to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and his Seed were the Promiſes made: he ſaith not, unto Seeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy Seed, which is Chriſt.</hi> And if you do believe as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> did, then are you <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed. So that thus briefly you ſee, who this Covenant is ſtricken with, and who are the ſubjects of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But then fifthly, ſuppoſe I be in Covenant with the Lord, or ſuppoſe I be not; if I be not, is there any great hurt? ſuppoſe I be, is there any great good?</p>
               <p>Much every way; give me leave to give you a little taſt of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If you be not in Covenant with God, how can you expect any bleſsing, mercy, or deliverance from God? for do but look into the Scripture, and you ſhall find, that all bleſsings, mercies and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances come to the people of God <hi>by vertue of the Covenant, and according to the Covenant:</hi> — Will you inſtance in <hi>outward</hi> deliveranc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, the World is not drowned again? Why? — but becauſe of the Covenant. — Will you inſtance in <hi>ſpiritual</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances? ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>He commandeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, he remembreth the Covenant;</hi> He maketh Redemption effectual by remembring the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. — Or will you inſtance in both together? ſee what is ſaid in the 9th of <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. <hi>As for thee alſo, by the blood of thy Covenant, I have ſent forth thy priſoners out of the pit, wherein is no water:</hi> It
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:171186:40"/> includes both outward and ſpiritual deliverances: So that now, if you be not in Covenant with God, what deliverance can you expect, or what mercy, ſeeing they all come by vertue of the Covenant, and according to the Covenant?</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, if you be in Covenant with the Lord, then are you exalted and honoured, yea, greatly honoured. For if it be an honour to be in League and Covenant with a great Prince, <hi>What an honour is it to be in Covenant with the great God?</hi> When God did ſpeak to <hi>Abraham</hi> of ſtriking a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, <hi>he falls down upon his face;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Who am I, that the great God ſhould be in Covenant with me?</p>
               <p>Again, If God be in Covenant with you, look whatever excellency there is in God, that is made over to you for your uſe. And as that King ſaid to him that was in League with him, My Horſe is thine, and my Men are thine, and my Money is thine; ſo when God enters into Covenant with a poor Soul, — he ſaith, My Wiſdome is thine, and my Power is thine, and my Love and Mercy is thine: <hi>Whatever excellency there is in God, is made over to you, being in Covenant with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if that you be in Covenant with the Lord, then all his Retinue, his Creatures, and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, alſo are in Covenant with you, in the 2d. of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 21. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in that day, I will hear, ſaith the Lord, I will hear the Heavens, and they ſhall hear the Earth, and the Earth ſhall hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyl, and they ſhall hear Jez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel.</hi> — Why? — <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and in Judgement, and in loving Kindneſs,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:171186:40"/> and in Mercies:</hi> And then <hi>it ſhall come to paſs, that I will hear the Heavens, and they ſhall hear the Earth, &amp;c.</hi> So that if you be in Covenant with God, then all his Retinue, all his Creatures, and all his Servants are in Covenant with you too.</p>
               <p>And if you be in Covenant with the Lord, then he is in Covenant with you, and your <hi>Soul,</hi> and your <hi>Body</hi> both; not on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Covenant may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved between a Man and his Wife at Death, <hi>but this Covenant can never be diſſolved;</hi> and though you ſin, and break with God, God will not break with you, <hi>I hate putting away,</hi> ſaith he.</p>
               <p>And then, you may go to God <hi>as upon a Throne of Grace, and look upon God as ſitting in a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow.</hi> Oh what a mercy, what a bleſsing is it to be in Covenant with the Lord?</p>
               <p>But in caſe I be not in Covenant with God, what ſhall I do to get into Covenant with him? — And in caſe I be in Covenant with God, how ſhall I walk ſo as becometh one that is in Covenant with the great God? Here are two Queſtions, I ſhall ſpeak briefly to them and conclude.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Do you ask what you ſhall do to get into Covenant? Are you affraid any of you, that you are not yet in Covenant with the Lord, and would you be in Covenant with the Lord?</p>
               <p>Why then be ſure of this, that upon a right and good underſtanding of the nature of this Covenant, you go to God, and <hi>make your choiſe of this Covenant of Grace, to ſtand and fall by.</hi> The word <hi>Berith</hi> in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:171186:41"/> the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for Covenant, ſome think comes from a root that ſignifies to chooſe; a man is in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that he chooſes, and <hi>every man is indeed as his choiſe is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then go and renounce the other Covenant of Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As the way to have a part in Chriſts Righteouſneſs is to renounce all your own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; ſo the way to have a ſhare in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, is to renounce the Covenant o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Works.</p>
               <p>Then go to Chriſt as the Mediator of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and deſire him to put you into this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; <hi>He ſtruck the Covenant with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the firſt,</hi> and he muſt put you into this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for he is the Mediator of the Covenant; go then to him, as to the Mediator of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to put you into Covenant.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>leave the weight and ſtreſs of your Guilty Soul upon this Covenant of Grace,</hi> bear upon this ſtream of Grace, here lay the weight of all, for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Promiſe is made ours by reſting on it; And what is this Covenant, but an abſolute Promiſe? there then reſt, and leave the weight of your Souls.</p>
               <p>And to ſay no more but this; Then go unto the Lord, and give your hand unto God, and your ſelf up to God, as one willing to be led by him into all the things that the Covenant ſhall require. In the times of the Old Teſtament, when they made a Covenant, they ſtruck hands together; In <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.19. it is ſaid, they <hi>gave their hands</hi> to put away their Wives; and in the former verſe, they made a Covenant to do it, <hi>They roſe, and made a Covenant to put away their Wives:</hi> And we find in the 1 of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> that when <hi>David</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:171186:41"/> was dead, that all the people came together, Chap. 24.24. And all the Princes, and the Mighty Men, and all the Sons likewiſe of King <hi>David, ſubmitted</hi> themſelves unto <hi>Solomon</hi> the King; the word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, <hi>they gave the hand under King Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> they gave their hand by way of Covenant, and they gave their hand under King <hi>Solomon,</hi> in a a way of ſubmiſsion. So when we enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Lord, we give our hand under God; and therefore if you deſire to get into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant do theſe things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Well, but ſuppoſe I be in Covenant with God, as I hope I am, What ſhould I do that I may walk as becometh one that is in Covenant with the great God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt of all, If you be in Covenant indeed with the Lord, then God hath honoured you, he hath exalted you, and honoured you greatly; and if God have honoured you, why ſhould not you honour God?</p>
               <p>Now firſt, the more you fall down at the feet of the fulneſs of Chriſt, in the ſenſe of your own unworthineſs, inability, and inſufficiency, the more you honour God: <hi>There is one,</hi> ſaith <hi>John, who is mightier then I, whoſe ſhooe latchet I am not worthy to unlooſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The more you cry up thoſe Ordinances and wayes of God, that are decryed by the World, the more you honour God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The more you keep cloſe to God in declining times, the more you honour God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The more you truſt God at a dead lift, when all means fails, and when a ſentence of death is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the means, the more you honour God.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:171186:42"/>5. The more you ſerve God, contrary to your own diſpoſition, and <hi>rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. And the more that you do prefer the things of God in time of competition above other things, the more you honour God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And the more you <hi>part with your much for Gods leſſer,</hi> the more you honour God. What is Honour? Honour is a teſtimony of anothers Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; <hi>Now when I can part with my much for Gods little, his little truths and things,</hi> I do teſtifie an excellency in God; I ſay, the more you can part with your much for Gods little, the more you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And the more you do keep cloſe to the Name and Faith of God and Chriſt, even where Satans Throne is, the more you honour God: Now then hath the Lord honoured you, and taken you into Covenant with himſelf; then ſurely it is your duty for to honour God, and by theſe ſeveral particulars you may honour God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Lord have made and ſtricken a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with you, then Friends give me leave to ſay to you, <hi>Why ſhould you be ſolicitous for your own things?</hi> If you be in Covenant with the Lord, and God in Covenant with you, God will take care of your things; therefore why ſhould you be ſolicitous about your owne things? God is in Covenant with you, he will take care of yours.</p>
               <p>And upon this account, in caſe there be any loſſe upon the things of God, why ſhould you not be <hi>as much affected for that loſſe, as for your owne loſſes?</hi> For if you be in Covenant with God,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:171186:42"/> and God with you; <hi>Gods things are yours, and your things are Gods:</hi> Gods things are yours, Why then ſhould you not be as much touched with the loſſe of any thing that concerns God, as with any thing that concerns your ſelves?</p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>Why ſhould not God have the uſe of all yours?</hi> God is in Covenant with you, and <hi>you have the uſe of Gods things,</hi> his Wiſdome, his Power, his Mercy; Why? — Becauſe he is in Covenant with you, and you are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him. <hi>Why then ſhould not God have the uſe of your thing alſo, your Name, and your Eſtate, and your Body, and your Time?</hi> If you be in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and God be in Covenant with you, yours are Gods, and Gods are yours; why ſhould not God have the uſe of yours, as you think to have the uſe of Gods?</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God be in Covenant with you, and you be in Covenant with God, then why ſhould you not live <hi>at an higher rate then the beſt of the Jews did?</hi> You are in a better Covenant then the Jews were; though for ſubſtance the ſame (as you heard) yet you are in a better Covenant, and ſhall not your lives be better?</p>
               <p>You have a better Mediator, and ſhall not your lives be better?</p>
               <p>You have better Promiſes, and ſhall not your lives be better?</p>
               <p>Your ſtate now is called <hi>Grace</hi> to That: <hi>The Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth comes by Chriſt, John</hi> 1. Chap. Look therefore upon the Jews, look into the Old Teſtament, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beſt of them, and think with your ſelves, am I in a better Covenant? Oh then how am I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:171186:43"/> to live better? Oh that our lives were more exalted upon this account. Why ſhould not our lives be better, and we live at a higher Rate?</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you be in Covenant with the Lord, and the Lord in Covenant with you, then be ſure of this, <hi>That you be true to God; be true to God in the matter of his Worſhip:</hi> the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſtricken between God and you, is a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Covenant.</hi> A Woman, though ſhe will admit another man into the houſe with her Husband, <hi>yet ſhe will not admit him into the bed,</hi> that is a breach of Covenant. Now <hi>the Worſhip of God is the bed wherein Chriſt doth bed with a Soul;</hi> and therefore if you look into the Old Teſtament, you ſhall find that Idolatry is accounted Adultry, and Harlotry: — Why? <hi>Becauſe they took Idols, and men into the bed with God.</hi> Would you walk then as thoſe that are in Covenant with the Lord, <hi>away with every thing of mans out of Chriſts bed, Remember it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Covenant?</hi> Whatſoever is of mans coming into the Worſhip of the Lord, which is the Lords bed, is againſt your Covenant. When God ſpeaks of a Covenant, he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt be for me, and I will be for thee,</hi> Hoſ. 3. Chap.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And to conclude all, if you be in Covenant with the Lord, and the Lord with you indeed, go away, and walk humbly, and be very thankfull. When the Lord made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham, Abraham,</hi> ſaith he, go thoughout the Land, and behold it in the breadth thereof, and in the length thereof; ſo ſay I, hath the Lord entered into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with you, go into the Land of the Covenant,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:171186:43"/> behold the length thereof, and the breadth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and what God hath promiſed in that Covenant: behold it in the length thereof, and the breadth thereof, and thus will your heart be affected and raiſed to thankfulneſs. Thus <hi>Davids</hi> heart was raiſed, for ſaith he, <hi>Lord, though thou makeſt not my houſe to grow, this is my ſalvation, I am in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with thee;</hi> And ſo you may ſay, Lord, thou makeſt not my Family to grow, I have never a Child, this is my ſalvation, I am in Covenant with thee; though thou makeſt not my houſe to grow, but I am poor, and my houſe is pulled down, or burnt down, this is my ſalvation, the Lord be praiſed, the Lord is in Covenant with me; thus do, and you ſhall be thankful.</p>
               <p>And this is the laſt thing, if you be in Covenant with the Lord, go away, <hi>walk humbly,</hi> and be <hi>thankfull,</hi> that God ſhould ever enter into this great Covenant, this Covenant of Grace with you, even with you.</p>
               <p>And ſo now I have done with the firſt argument, that there is a Covenant ſtricken with the Children of men: The ſecond follows, Jeſus is the Mediator of this Covenant.</p>

                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:171186:44"/>5. What are the benefits that we do gain by Jeſus his being Mediator of the New Covenant.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Give you ſome doctrinal Corrolaries, and practical Duties that do flow from hence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And Firſt, If you ask, what is the proper work of a Mediator, that is, a Mediator between God and us,</p>
               <p>I anſwer, It is to make peace and reconciliation between God and us. At the firſt, in the ſtate of innocency, there was peace and friendſhip between God and Man, there was no enmity in Gods heart towards his creature, nor no enmity in Mans heart towards his Creator; but upon the Fall, a breach and ſeparation was made between God and us, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as we are all by Nature the children of wrath, God is angry; — And an enmity is in us towards God: <hi>The wiſdome of the fleſh is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Now therefore, the work of a Mediator is to reconcile God to us, and to reconcile us unto God, both which you have in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the Miniſtry of reconciliation, to wit, That God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf:</hi> There is reconciliation on Gods part, for it is ſaid, <hi>He was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf: Not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their treſpaſſes unto them.</hi> — Then at the 20. verſe you have reconciliation on our part, <hi>Now then, we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e reconciled unto God.</hi> Here is both reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Only you muſt know, That we do not find in expreſs tearms in Scripture, that <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:171186:45"/> 
                  <hi>reconciled to us,</hi> but <hi>we</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>reconciled to him,</hi> becauſe we are the parties offending, and God the Party offended: Now the Scripture alwayes ſpeaks ſo, that the Party <hi>offending,</hi> is to reconcile himſelf, or to be reconciled, as in the 5. of <hi>Math. If thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leave thy gift, and firſt be reconciled to thy brother.</hi> Thou that haſt offended, go and be reconciled to thy brother: and ſo we ſay in ordinary ſpeech, if a man have juſtly provoked another, Go and reconcile your ſelf unto him, that is, do that whereby he may be pacified and ſatisfied. And ſo God is reconciled unto us, when we do that whereby his anger may be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, and he pacified, which is the work of a Mediator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what need a Mediator for this work (ſay the <hi>Socinians</hi>) for God was alwayes willing to be reconciled to us, <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his Son:</hi> He loved them firſt, before Chriſt; what need a Mediator then, ſay they.</p>
               <p>And ſay the <hi>Arminians,</hi> to invalidate and iner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Election, If we be elected, and ſo loved from all eternity, what need a Mediator to bring about actual reconciliation in time.</p>
               <p>To all which I anſwer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, very much: For,</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt know that this reconciliation with God, or God being reconciled to us, <hi>doth not make a real change in the inward affection of God,</hi> but in the outward diſpenſation of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You muſt know this; <hi>That God may be willing to be reconciled unto us, in regard of his eternal good will, and yet not be actually reconciled in regard of his diſpenſations.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> was willing to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>Abſolom,</hi> but he was not actually reconciled, and therefore <hi>Joab</hi> comes as a Mediator between them, to bring about the actual reconciliation. And if you look into the laſt of <hi>Job,</hi> you will find, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covius</hi> doth well obſerve to the purpoſe in hand, That when God was very angry with <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his friends (inſomuch as the Lord ſaid to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> at the 7th verſe, <hi>My wrath is kindled againſt thee and againſt thy two friends</hi>) that yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then God puts them upon a means of taking away his diſpleaſure: <hi>Therefore take unto you now ſeven Bullocks, and ſeven Rams, and go to my ſervant Job, and offer up for your ſelves a burnt offering, and my ſervant Job ſhall pray for you,</hi> and mediate for you. So that God was angry, and his wrath kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, yet he was willing to be reconciled, and finds out a Mediator to bring about this actual reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. And ſo here, although God be angry with his own Elect, in regard of the diſpenſation, yet notwithſtanding he may be willing to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:171186:46"/> in regard of his eternal good will: But</p>
               <p n="4">4. You muſt know this alſo, that God may, and doth, <hi>Will this for that ſometimes,</hi> and yet <hi>not for this will that,</hi> as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>For Example, God doth will Rain for Corne, and Rain is the cauſe of Corn will'd: He doth will Rain for Corn, yet Corn is not the cauſe of his will willing the Corn. So here, God doth will Chriſts Mediation for Reconciliation, and the Mediation of Chriſt is the cauſe of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but yet notwithſtanding, the Mediation of Chriſt, is not the cauſe of Gods Will, willing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. So that thus now you ſee, what the proper work of a Mediator is, that is, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate between God and us, it is to reconcile God to us, and to reconcile us unto God; That's the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Jeſus was, and is the fitteſt perſon in the World to mediate between God and us. There was no creature fit to Umpire the buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us; and therefore <hi>Job</hi> ſaith well, at the 9th. Chap. 33. verſe, <hi>Neither is there any dayes-man betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both</hi> — Man was not fit to mediate, becauſe man is the perſon offending; — <hi>Angels</hi> not fit to mediate, for the ſhoulder of an Angel could not bear the weight of Mediation-Work, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could an Angel ſatisfie. — <hi>God the Father,</hi> not fit for this work, the firſt perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for he was the perſon offended. — The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> not fit for this work, for 'tis his work to apply the blood of this mediation; ſo then, there is none other fit, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> fit, <hi>Jeſus</hi> fit, The fitteſt perſon.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:171186:46"/>
               <p>For firſt of all, he is the perſon appointed by the Father. If a man will undertake to mediate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two, and be not choſen thereunto, he is not fit for it, but if choſen, then he is fit. Why Jeſus is the perſon choſen, <hi>mine elect Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> ſaith the Father, <hi>Whom I have choſen, I have given him for a Covenant unto the People,</hi> Iſa. 42.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was and is the fitteſt perſon to mediate between God and us, for he is a middle perſon, partaking of Gods nature, and of mans. Extreams are joyn'd together by a middle: who <hi>more fit</hi> to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate between two, then he that is a <hi>middle</hi> between them?</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is the fitteſt perſon, for he is the fitteſt to make reconciliation between God and us, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile God to us, and us unto God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is the fitteſt to reconcile God to us; for that God might be reconciled, he muſt be ſatisfied, his Juſtice ſatisfied, and his Anger ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: Now Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> as <hi>Man,</hi> he ought to ſatisfie, but could not; as <hi>God,</hi> he could ſatisfie, but he ought not: but as <hi>God-man,</hi> he both could and ought, and ſo the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. And again,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Who more fit to reconcile God unto us, then he that was the moſt fit to intercede, that had credit and favour, and love with the Father? Now <hi>Jeſus lay in the boſome of his Father; This is my beloved Son:</hi> and <hi>I was the Fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> ſaith he in the 8th of <hi>Prov.</hi> Therefore the moſt fit to intercede, and ſo to reconcile God unto us.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:171186:47"/>3. Who more fit to reconcile God to us, then he that was fit to be a ſurety, to undertake for us. If a man come to mediate with a perſon offended, for another: Saith the perſon offended, but will you undertake he ſhall do ſo no more? — Yes, — Why then I am willing. Now <hi>Jeſus</hi> is called <hi>our ſurety,</hi> in the 8th. <hi>Heb.</hi> He undertakes that though we have broken with God already, we ſhall break no more; and therefore the fitteſt perſon to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile God to us.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, the fitteſt perſon alſo to reconcile us to God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Who more fit to reconcile us to God, then he that can change our natures? Now <hi>Jeſus</hi> is able to change our nature: <hi>I find,</hi> ſaith Paul, <hi>a Law in my Members, rebelling againſt the Law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity unto the Law of ſin which is in my members: O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> then, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And Rom. 8.2. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="2">2. Who more fit to reconcile us to God, then he that can beget good thoughts in us concerning God? So long as a man hath hard thoughts of God, he will never be reconciled to God. Now Jeſus Chriſt lay in the boſome of his Father, and can tell the Soul what volumes of Love there were and are in the boſome of the Father, for it, from all eternity, and ſo can beget love in the Soul towards God, and ſo able to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Soul to God. You have it clearly in <hi>John</hi> 1.18. he lay in the boſome of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:171186:47"/>3. And then to ſay no more but this, Who more fit to reconcile us to God, then he that can give the Holy Ghoſt into our Souls? For as God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to us by the blood of Chriſt, ſo we are reconciled to God by the Spirit of Chriſt: Now Jeſus gives the Spirit, <hi>I will ſend the Comforter,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; ſo that he, he is the fitteſt perſon in all the world to reconcile God to us, and to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us to God, and ſo the fitteſt perſon in all the world to mediate between God and us. And ſo you have the ſecond thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But then thirdly, As <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the fitteſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to mediate between God and us, ſo he hath undertaken this work of Mediation, and he will certainly carry it on unto due perfection.</p>
               <p>Firſt (I ſay) he hath undertaken it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called <hi>the</hi> Mediator, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and Man, the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and he alone is <hi>the</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. I confeſs indeed the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 3d. of <hi>Gal.</hi> is called a a Mediator. <hi>The Law was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator,</hi> verſ. 19. that is not Chriſt. <hi>But the Law was ordained by Angels, in the hand,</hi> that is, by the Miniſtry of a Mediator: — <hi>Chriſt was not the Miniſter of Angels, Moſes was;</hi> and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> is to be underſtood here. The ſame word that is uſed concerning Chriſt, is uſed here.</p>
               <p>But now, although <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Mediator, a <hi>Typical</hi> Mediator, and did ſtand between God and the people, as in the 5th. of <hi>Deut.</hi> to deliver out the Law unto them, verſ. 5. <hi>I ſtood between the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:171186:48"/> Lord and you at that time, to ſhew you the word of the Lord.</hi> Though (I ſay) <hi>Moſes</hi> is called a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> becauſe he ſtood between God and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to give and deliver out the Law to them, yet you never find that <hi>Moſes</hi> is called a Mediator in a way of Redemption, or ſatisfaction, or paying of any ranſome; ſo <hi>Jeſus</hi> onely is: In the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſome for all.</hi> And ſo in the 9th <hi>Heb. For this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> — For what cauſe? — Why? <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal ſpirit offered up himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God;</hi> and for <hi>this cauſe</hi> is he the Mediator. It is never ſaid ſo of <hi>Moſes;</hi> — No, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Mediator, and <hi>he onely</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator in a way of ſatisfaction, and redemption, and paying of a price. Well, thus he hath undertaken the work.</p>
               <p>And certainly, he will carry on his work of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, unto due perfection; for ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, he is faithfull in all his houſe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was: <hi>Moſes</hi> a Servant, he as a Son. <hi>Moſes</hi> the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator was faithfull in all the houſe of God, to a pin: Surely <hi>Jeſus the Son</hi> will be faithful in this work of Mediation, and carry it on to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt.</p>
               <p>But then you will ſay, what aſſurance have we, that Jeſus will carry on this work of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the uttermoſt, unto due perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:171186:48"/>
               <p>Firſt of all, you have the aſſurance of the firſt great promiſe that was made, <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpents head,</hi> Gen. 3. Saith the Lord to the Serpent, <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed.</hi> If there be enmity between Satan and us, there will be peace between God and us; where God ſaith he will put enmity between the Devil and us, he doth there promiſe, that there ſhall be peace and reconciliation between God and us; — now this here he ſaith, — And how ſhall this be done? — <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi> It ſhall be done by him whoſe heel in his ſufferings is bruiſed by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and his Inſtruments; It ſhall be done by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As you have the aſſurance of the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſo you have the aſſurance of what Chriſt hath done already; he will not looſe what he hath done, he will not looſe his work. If Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt did not boggle nor ſtartle at, nor fly back from the hardeſt piece of Mediation, which was to ſatisfie for our ſins, ſurely he will not give in, and ſtart back from the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier part, which is, to intercede in Heaven, <hi>ſeeing he ever lives to make interceſſion for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As you have the aſſurance of what he hath done, ſo you have the aſſurance alſo of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in this work of mediation. If a man <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake</hi> a work, be <hi>able</hi> to carry it through, and <hi>take delight</hi> therein, he will certainly carry it on. Now our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath undertaken
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:171186:49"/> this work: — he is able, God and Man, — and he hath a delight in this work, <hi>I delight to do thy will,</hi> ſaith he, in the 8th <hi>Prov. I was by him, as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight, rejoycing alwayes before him, rejoycing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were with the ſons of men.</hi> Chriſt's heart was much in this work of Mediation, inſomuch, as if you look into the 3d of <hi>Mal.</hi> you ſhall find he <hi>ſits</hi> by it, and he ſhall <hi>ſit</hi> as a refiner and purifier of ſilver, and he ſhall purifie the Sons of <hi>Levi:</hi> — Why? — <hi>That they may offer unto the Lord an offering in Righteouſneſs: then ſhall the offerings of</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>be pleaſant unto the Lord, as in the dayes of old, and as in former years.</hi> — Who is this that <hi>ſits</hi> thus at it? — Why, in the former verſe it is ſaid, <hi>Even the Meſſenger of the Covenant,</hi> that is, Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Behold I will ſend my Meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the way before me;</hi> theres <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. <hi>And the Lord whom ye ſeek, ſhall ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to his Temple, even the Meſſenger of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> — (here's Chriſt) <hi>whom ye delight in:</hi> — Behold he ſhall come; and what ſhall he do? — Why, he ſhall <hi>ſit</hi> at this work, his heart is much in this work, his delight is in it; and therefore you have the aſſurance of his <hi>delight,</hi> that he will carry it on.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As you have the aſſurance of his Delight, ſo you have the aſſurance of his <hi>Name and Title, JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> Jeſus the Mediator of the Covenant. — why <hi>Jeſus?</hi> why not <hi>Chriſt?</hi> why not <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as in other Scriptures?</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:171186:49"/>
               <p>Look into the Book of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and you ſhall find frequently that Chriſt is called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> — Why? becauſe this Title was more ſutable to the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is opening in the Book of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> — It notes alſo the Deity of Chriſt: <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſignifies <hi>Saviour;</hi> they go here together, Jeſus the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, — Why? becauſe as he is a Mediator in order to our ſalvation, ſo he is a Saviour in the way of Mediation; Therefore they go here toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore as Jeſus is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, ſo as Mediator he will perform this work of Mediation to the uttermoſt. And thus now I have done with the third thing, namely, That Jeſus hath undertaken this work, To mediate between God and us, and he will certainly carry it on unto due perfection.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But then Fourthly, How, and in what reſpects is Jeſus ſaid to be the Mediator of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?</p>
               <p>Upon a threefold account.</p>
               <p>Upon the account of ſtipulation, — Upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Confirmation, — Upon the account of Suretiſhip.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is the Mediator of the New Covenant upon the account of ſtipulation, for he it was that did ſtrike the Covenant for us with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. See what is ſaid in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>Who hath ſaved us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and called us with an holy call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the World began.</hi> So that there was a Treatment between God the Father and Chriſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:171186:50"/> concerning us; and Chriſt received grace for us before the World began. — And as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> did ſtrike the Covenant of works with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his Seed, ſo <hi>Jeſus</hi> did ſtrike the Covenant of grace for his Seed with God the Father, and ſo called the <hi>ſecond Adam.</hi> A Mediator therefore of the New Covenant he is, in regard of ſtipulation, he it was that ſtruck up the Covenant firſt with the Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As he is a Mediator of the New Covenant upon the account of ſtipulation, ſo upon the account of Confirmation; for he hath confirmed the Covenant. — He confirmed the Covenant by his active obedience while he lived, and by his paſſive obedience when he died.</p>
               <p>By his active obedience while he lived, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.27. <hi>He ſhall confirm the Covenant with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for one Week. Larabbim,</hi> you read it <hi>with many,</hi> but rather he ſhall confirm the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>for many;</hi> not for all, but he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Covenant for many for one Week.</p>
               <p>And he did confirme the Covenant alſo by his paſſive obedience, in his Death, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 9. <hi>For this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, That by means of death for the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called might receive the Promiſe. For</hi> (the Apoſtle explains it by a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude) <hi>Where a Teſtament is, there muſt alſo of neceſſity be the death of the Teſtator. For a Teſtament is of force after men are dead; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is of no ſtrength at all, whilſt the Teſtator liveth.</hi> So that plainly then, The Lord Jeſus
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:171186:50"/> Chriſt did confirme the Covenant by his Death.</p>
               <p>Onely the Queſtion is, how Chriſt did confirme the Covenant by his death?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> would make the World believe, that Chriſt did confirme the Covenant by his death, in a way of Teſtimony and witneſſe-bearing onely; for ſay they, Chriſt preached the Goſpel while he liv'd, and when he dyed, he did by his death ſeal it, and confirme the truth thereof: thus they ſay, that Chriſt did confirme the Covenant by his death, onely in a way of witneſſe-bearing, in a way of Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>But ſurely this cannot be it, for if Chriſt did confirme the Covenant by his death; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed not the Covenant onely by witneſſe-bearing to the truth, for ſo the Apoſtles might be ſaid to confirme the Covenant, for in the 2 Heb. 3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if our Lord and Saviour ſhould onely confirme the Covenant by his death, in a way of witneſſe-bearing, <hi>then the Martyrs that dyed for the Truth, ſhould confirme the Covenant by their Death too,</hi> for they by their death did ſeal to the Truth, and did bear witneſs to the Truth, and ſo they ſhould be ſaid to confirme the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but far be it from us to think any ſuch thing.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:171186:51"/>
               <p>But Jeſus Chriſt did confirme the Covenant by his death thus, <hi>By performing the condition of the Covenant, and by laying down his blood a price for the mercies and bleſſings promiſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He did confirme the Covenant by his death, (I ſay) <hi>by performing the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> If a man be in captivity, and he that hath him in captivity promiſes, upon the payment of ſo much money that he ſhall be delivered, when the money is paid down, the Condition is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; Why, now <hi>Jeſus</hi> when he dyed, he gave himſelf a ranſome for many, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yea, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and upon this account, he is called a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one God, and one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a Ranſome,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Ranſome in the room, a Ranſome for, or in the room of us.</p>
               <p>As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have confirmed the Covenant and did not, ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> did confirme the Covenant. — How ſhould the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> have confirmed the Covenant? — Why, the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have confirmed the Covenant by performing the condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. So now our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> did confirme the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, — How? — by performing the condition of the Covenant: Thus he is the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of the New Covenant, upon the account of Confirmation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is the Mediator of the New Covenant upon the account of <hi>Suretyſhip,</hi> by being bound
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:171186:51"/> unto God the Father that we ſhall performe to him, by being bound to us that God the Father ſhall performe to us. In the 7th of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> you ſhall find he is called <hi>our Surety, verſ.</hi> 22. By ſo much was Jeſus made a <hi>Surety</hi> of a better Teſtament: — And why ſo? but to ſhew, that where he is Mediator, he is Surety. You know what a <hi>Surety</hi> is, he is bound for the Debtor to performe. Saith <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> unto his Father <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 43.9. when he would have <hi>Benjamin</hi> down with him to <hi>Egypt, I'le be ſurety for him, of my hand ſhalt thou require him;</hi> So Chriſt ſaith unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will be Surety for theſe men, and of my hand ſhalt thou require their performance;— and ſaith he to them again, I will be Surety for God the Father, and of my hand ſhall you require his mercies. So that thus now he is a Mediator of the New Covenant, upon an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Suretiſhip, upon a threefold account; — upon the account of Stipulation, — upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Confirmation, — upon the account of Suretiſhip.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But what are the benefits that we do gain or get by Jeſus being the Mediator of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant?</p>
               <p>Much every way.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, Is it not a great matter that God the Father ſhould be reconciled unto us? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he ground of Communication; ſurely therefore it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:171186:52"/> is no ſmall matter. Now I ſay, if Jeſus be the Mediator of the New Covenant, God is reconciled to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Jeſus be the Mediator of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, then you may go with boldneſſe, and look the Juſtice of God in the face; <hi>with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> for your debt is ſatisfied: So long as a man is in debt, <hi>he ſteals by the Priſon door in the dark;</hi> but if his Surety have paid the debt, he dares come (as you ſay) and <hi>whet his knife at the Counter door.</hi> Now Chriſt being your Mediator, the Mediator of the New Covenant, he is your Surety, the debt is paid, and you may goe with boldneſſe and looke Juſtice in the face, and the Devil, and all thoſe Serjeants of Hell.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, Is it not a great matter for Chriſt to be your <hi>King, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Prophet?</hi> conſider it a little: If you obſerve it, you ſhall find that all the bleſſings that came to the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> in the time of the Old Teſtament, came through theſe three offices, King, Prieſt, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; why, but as a Type, to ſhew that all our ſpiritual mercies muſt come through the hand of theſe three offices in Chriſt: Now if Chriſt be the Mediator of the New Covenant, then he is your King, your Prieſt, your Prophet; <hi>for all theſe three offices of Chriſt, grow upon the Mediation of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if he be your Mediator, then he will be a Prophet, a Prophet to declare the mind, and the love of the Father to you.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:171186:52"/>
               <p>If he be your Mediator, he will be your Prieſt, to ſatisfie the Fathers anger for you.</p>
               <p>If he be your Mediator, he will be a King to ſubdue all your Enemies, for he is a Prieſt after the Order of <hi>Melcheſedeck,</hi> King of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Now is it not a great matter to have Chriſt our King, our Prieſt, our Prophet? ſurely it is: But</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is it not a great matter, that all the bleſſings and mercies of the New Covenant ſhould belong unto you? Friends, have you duly conſidered what are the bleſſings of the New Covenant? I'le tell you briefly;</p>
               <p>They are all thoſe ſpiritual bleſſings which you want, and complaine for the want of. There are ſeven or eight ſpiritual bleſſings that a poor drooping ſoul doth complaine for the want of.</p>
               <p>Oh ſaith he, I am afraid I am not the Child of God, — or I fear my ſin is not pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, — and I do not find an inward conſtant frame of Soul to what is good, — And I am a poor ignorant creature, — And I have a hard heart, — And I want the Spirit of the Lord within me, — And I cannot walk with God as I ought to do, — And I fear I ſhall fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and go to Hell at laſt.

               <p>Do you ſay, O but I don't find that conſtant frame of heart unto what is good? why, ſaith the Lord in the Covenant, <hi>I will write my Law in your heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do you ſay, O but I am a poor ignorant creature? why, ſaith the Lord in the Covenant, <hi>You ſhall all know me from the greateſt to the leaſt, and you ſhall be taught of God.</hi>

               <p>Do you ſay, O but my heart is hard? why ſaith the Lord in the Covenant, <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, and give an heart of fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do you ſay, O but I want the Spirit of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me? why, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you.</hi>

               <p>Do you ſay, I cannot walk with God as I ought? why, ſaith the Lord in the Covenant, <hi>I will cauſe you to walk in my wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do you ſay, I fear I ſhall fall away, and goe to hell at laſt? why, ſaith the Lord in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, I will put my fear into your hearts, and you ſhall not depart from me. — Theſe, even theſe beſides Heaven, and beſides the bleſſings of this Earth, ſo all theſe bleſſings are promiſed in the Covenant of Grace; and if Chriſt be the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the New Covenant, then do theſe bleſſing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:171186:53"/> you, to take up all differences as they may ariſe? why, if Jeſus be the Mediator of the Covenant, ſo it is, <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, who is the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Is it not a great matter for you to enter into the Holy of Holyeſt, and to have all your duties carried in to God the Father by the hand of Jeſus? If he be your Mediator, ſo it is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Is it not a great matter, in caſe that you have to deal with enemies, either for Soul or Body, to have one by, that can and will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe and rebuke them? Why, if Jeſus be the Mediator of the Covenant, thus ſhall it be. He interpoſed between <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> when <hi>Laban</hi> followed <hi>Jacob,</hi> he rebuked <hi>Laban.</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed in the caſe of <hi>Joſhua, when Satan ſtood at his right hand: the Lord rebuke thee,</hi> as in the 3d Chapter of <hi>Zechary.</hi> The ſame word in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> that <hi>Job</hi> uſeth for <hi>Dayes-man,</hi> comes from a root that ſignifies to <hi>rebuke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. And then to ſay no more in it but this, Is it not a great matter for one that is in trouble, or affliction of ſpirit, to have Chriſt to interpoſe between God the Father and him, when he lyes under the ſenſe of Gods wrath and diſpleaſure? Why, if Chriſt be the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the New Covenant, then thus it is; Look into the 33. Chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> and ſee what a ſcheme and mold of Converſion-work there is, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>God ſpeaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not:</hi> — Here is man in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:171186:54"/> his naturall ſtate and condition, going on in the way of his ſin, living under the means; and God ſpeaking once and twice, and he perceives it not. Well then at the 15th <hi>verſ. In a dream, in a viſion of the night, when deep ſleep falleth upon men, in ſlumbrings upon the bed, then he openeth the ears of men, and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their inſtruction.</hi> Here comes a work of Conviction and Converſion, <hi>ſuddenly, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly,</hi> — and what then? then trouble of Conſcience, at the 19th <hi>verſ. He is chaſtened alſo with paine upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with ſtrong paine, ſo that his life ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth bread, and his ſoul dainty meat; his fleſh is conſumed away that it cannot be ſeen, and his bones that were not ſeen ſtick out; his ſoul draweth nigh unto the Grave, and his life to the Deſtroyers:</hi> — What then? why then at the 23. <hi>verſ. If there be a Meſſenger;</hi> Chriſt is the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of the Covenant: <hi>If there be a Meſſenger with him, an Interpreter,</hi> an Advocate; if there be a Meſſenger with him, or an Advocate by him, <hi>one of a thouſand,</hi> as Chriſt is, <hi>To ſhew unto man his Righteouſneſs,</hi> where his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe lyes, — What then? why <hi>then he is gracious unto him, and ſaith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a Ranſome.</hi> And then, <hi>his fleſh ſhall be freſher then a childs, he ſhall returne to the dayes of his Youth, he ſhall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him, and he ſhall ſee his face with joy, for he will render unto man his Righteouſneſſe.</hi> Thus now ſhall it be, if Jeſus be the Mediator
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:171186:54"/> of the New Covenant. Oh what a confortable thing therefore is it, for Jeſus to be this Mediator of the Covenant! And thus you ſee in the 5th place what thoſe benefits are that we do gaine thereby.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But then ſixthly, what are thoſe doctrinal Corrolaries, or practical duties, that do flow from hence?</p>
               <p n="1">1. If <hi>Jeſus</hi> be the Mediator of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, what an evil thing is it, and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for men to think, or ſpeak, or do any thing that may reflect upon this Mediator of the New Covenant, or to ſin againſt this New Covenant? There are ſome Opinions that do reflect and caſt a black reflection upon <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Mediator of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Socinian</hi> tells us, that Jeſus is a Mediator, ſuch a one as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, to declare the mind of God unto us; but not a Mediator in way of ſatisfaction, to ſatisfie Gods wrath.</p>
               <p>They ſay he is a Mediator, but not a Surety, to merit for us, or to pay our debt for us.</p>
               <p>They ſay he is a Mediator, but deny the Deity of Chriſt, and ſo root up the very mediation of Chriſt; they caſt a very black reflection upon this Mediator.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> they ſay, that Chriſt is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and our onely Mediator in a way of Redemption, but we have many Mediators in a way of Interceſſion, Saints and Angels.</p>
               <p>They ſay that Chriſt is Mediator, but according to his humane nature only, whereas the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>that he offered up himſelf through the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:171186:55"/> Eternal Spirit:</hi> Thus they reflect upon this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</p>
               <p>And for practiſe, Is it not a great reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Mediator for us to think, that we our ſelves by our own Tears, and Faſtings, and Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, can reconcile God unto us, or pacifie Gods Anger, or make an Attonement for a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Is it not a very great reflection upon this Mediator to ſay, O my ſins are greater then can be forgiven? Is not this a very blameable reflection upon this Mediator of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?</p>
               <p>But there are four or five wayes eſpecially wherein we do ſin againſt the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by not looking into it, not ſtudying it, not being acquainted with it. Shall the Lord Jeſus be ſuch a Mediator of ſuch a Covenant, and ſhall we not look into the Covenant, and be acquainted with it? Yet Lord, how many poor ſouls are there that are ignorant of this Covenant? What unthankfulneſſe is this, what a ſin againſt the Covenant is this, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould be the Mediator of the Covenant, and men ſhould not look into it, not ſtudy it, not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes we ſin againſt the Covenant, by altering the mold and the frame of the Covenant, <hi>by hanging our conditions upon Gods Covenant, our pad-lock upon Gods door.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes we ſin againſt the Covenant, by ſlighting that Great Ordinance of the Lords Supper, concerning which Chriſt hath ſaid,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:171186:55"/> This Cup is the New Teſtament in my blood: To ſlight it, ſaying, theſe are low things, we are above Ordinances, and theſe are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things, now thus to ſlight it, is to ſin di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sometimes we ſin againſt the Covenant, by our unbelief and doubting. But</p>
               <p n="5">5. Sometimes we ſin againſt the Covenant, by turning the Grace of this Covenant into wantonneſſe. Is this true? that the Lord hath promiſed mercy upon no condition to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us, then why may we not live as we liſt, ſay men? Thus turning this Grace of God in the Covenant into wantonneſſe. But is this true, that Jeſus is the Mediator of the New Covenant? Why then ſhould we think, ſpeak, or do any thing that may reflect againſt this Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or ſin againſt this Covenant? That is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Jeſus be the Mediator of the New Covenant, why then, why ſhould you not truſt in the Lord for ever, build upon him, and be ſecure as to the mercies and bleſſings promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Covenant? If you come to a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to lodge in, and you ſee that it is laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on weak, or lathy props, that the foundation be not ſure, you ſay, I will not venture to lodge here; but if you come to a Chamber that is laid upon a good foundation, you ſay then, I durſt venture to lodge here: Why this New Covenant is founded upon the <hi>blood</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>The blood of Chriſt is the foundation of the New Covenant;</hi> And therefore why ſhould you
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:171186:56"/> not reſt, and be ſecure, confident, as concerning the mercies and bleſſings promiſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> O but you will ſay, I cannot be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Chriſt is my Mediator; I know that Chriſt is a Mediator of the New Covenant, but I cannot think that he doth mediate for me. If indeed I were perſwaded that Jeſus were my Mediator, or that he did mediate for me in particular, Ah then I ſhould truſt in the Lord indeed for the bleſſings of the Covenant: But I cannot be perſwaded that Chriſt is my Mediator; I grant he is the Mediator of the New Covenant, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that he is my Mediator, or that he doth mediate for me, and therefore I cannot be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No! What, the Father ſatisfied, who is the perſon offended, and you not ſatisfied, who are the perſon offending!</p>
               <p>No! Why if the <hi>Jew</hi> had ſinned, and the High-Prieſt had offered an Offering, or a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for him, the ſinning Jew would not ſay, this was not for me, and therefore I am not ſatisfied, for the ſacrifice was not for me; He would not ſay ſo, but he would ſay that he was ſatisfied: And ſhall <hi>Jeſus</hi> be our great High-Prieſt, and ſhall <hi>He</hi> make an offering of himſelfe for us, and will you ſay, it is not for me?</p>
               <p>But to come a little nearer to your Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I may bring this great doctrine home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtle hath ſaid, <hi>If any man ſin we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous;</hi> what think you, are you not within the compaſs of thoſe words, <hi>if any man ſin,</hi> will not thoſe words reach you?</p>
               <p>But if God be reconciled unto you, then Chriſt hath mediated for you; now God the Father is reconciled to you, for if you be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, and the things of God, then God is reconciled to you. Pray tell me, were you not an Enemy once to the good wayes of God, and the things of God? Yes; — And are you not reconciled now to the things of God? — Yes, I confeſſe I am: Well, if you be reconciled to the things of God, God is reconciled to you; and if God be reconciled to you, I am ſure Chriſt hath mediated for you. <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to ſay, The onely way to make God our Friend, is to caſt our ſelves into his armes when he ſeems to be our Enemy. Thus have you done, (poor ſoul?) when God hath ſeem'd to be your Enemy, then have you caſt your ſelves into the armes of God? ſurely then God is reconciled unto you, and Chriſt is your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</p>
               <p>Againe, If you be the Seed of Chriſt, then Chriſt is your Mediator, and Chriſt hath, and doth mediate for you; for he is a Mediator for his Seed. Now mark it, there are but two Seeds, the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of the Serpent; <hi>I will put Enmity between thy
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:171186:57"/> Seed and the Seed of the Woman.</hi> There are but two Seeds: how think you, are you the Seed of the Serpent? Either you are Chriſt's Seed, or the Seed of the Serpent, and <hi>that's an hiſſing Seed, an oppoſing Seed:</hi> Do you think you are the Seed of the Serpent? No, I hope I am not the Seed of the Serpent; why, then you are the Seed of Chriſt, and Chriſt doth mediate for you: Now then humble your ſelves for all your unbelief, and lay the weight of your guilty Soul upon this ſweet Covenant of Grace, for Jeſus is the Mediator of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, This Doctrine methinks looks very wiſhly upon all ſorts; — It looks wiſhly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that are good, and upon thoſe that are bad; It looks wiſhly upon thoſe that are Godly, and upon thoſe that are Ungodly; upon thoſe that are Converted, and upon thoſe that are not Converted.</p>
               <p>Upon thoſe that are Bad, Wicked, Ungodly, Unconverted, and to them it ſaith, why ſhould not you, even you come unto God for the Grace of this New Covenant, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Chriſt the Mediator? Why ſhould not you, you that are unconverted, goe unto God the Father, and preſſe him to give out the Grace of this Covenant to you? Hath not the Lord ſaid, <hi>Let not the Eunuch ſay, I am a dry tree; onely let him take hold of my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Neither let the Son of the Stranger, that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:171186:57"/> hath joyned himſelf to the Lord, ſpeak, ſaying, The Lord hath utterly ſeparated me from his people; Onely let him take hold of my Covenant, and do the things that pleaſe me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This New Covenant confirmed by Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Mediator, either it is confirmed for Saints only, or for Sinners alſo, that are Sinners for the preſent.</p>
               <p>If for Saints onely, why doth the Lord ſay, I will write my Law in your hearts? Surely therefore it is for ſome, in whoſe heart Gods Law is not yet written. And if this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant doth extend to ſuch, who as yet have not the Law written, the Law of Grace writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their hearts, Oh what encouragement is here for a poor ſinner to go to God, and ſay, Lord thou haſt made this Covenant, and Chriſt hath confirmed it, and he is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of it; now this Law is not yet writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in my heart; O make good thy Covenant, and write thy Law in my heart.</p>
               <p>And for you that are Saints, this Doctrine looks upon you, and it ſaith thus; If Chriſt be the Mediator of the New Covenant, and your Mediator, that God hath provided for you, then go away, and be aſhamed of your ſins, and of all your doings, the pardon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of requires ſuch a Mediator, and the blood of the Mediator; <hi>Then ſhall ye be aſhamed,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>When I am pacified towards you:</hi> If
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:171186:58"/> Chriſt be your Mediator, and God be pacified, Oh then be you aſhamed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And to you it ſpeaks thus. If the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be the Mediator of this New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, your Mediator, and mediates for you, then why ſhould not you appeare for Chriſt on Earth upon all occaſions? Shall Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe with the Father, and appeare for you, and mediate for you in Heaven upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and will not you appear for Chriſt on Earth? <hi>What, Chriſt appeare for you in Heaven, and mediate for you in Heaven, and will not you appeare for Chriſt on Earth?</hi> Yea, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you it ſaith, Why ſhould not you all goe away with your hearts full of Love and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, both to God the Father, and to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? If you were going to the Priſon for a Debt, and a man ſhould meet you, and undertake to be your Surety, and pay your Debt, you would love him as long as you lived: Here is the caſe, we were all going to Priſon, Chriſt comes, undertakes to be our Surety, payes our Debt; then will you not love Chriſt the Mediator of the New Covenant? Will you not love him, and be thankfull to him, and to God the Father? For though the <hi>performance</hi> of this Mediation be <hi>Chriſts,</hi> the <hi>Contrivance</hi> is <hi>God the Fathers.</hi> God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did contrive this Covenant, and God the Father did ſend Chriſt this Mediator; <hi>[I] have given thee for a Covenant,</hi> ſaith the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſaith Chriſt, Lo, I come to do <hi>Thy
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:171186:58"/> Will.</hi> Friends, it was the will of God the Father, that Jeſus ſhould be the Mediator of this New Covenant. Oh the freeneſſe of the Grace of God the Father! <hi>He</hi> was the perſon offended; and yet, that <hi>He himſelf</hi> ſhould find out ſuch a Mediator, of ſuch a Covenant, what Grace is here! Now therefore bleſſed be God the Father for this Mediator, let us all ſay; and bleſſed be this Mediator <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> who hath mediated us into this New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Goe away (I ſay) you that are Saints with your hearts full of Love, both unto God the Father, who hath contrived this Mediation, and unto <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> who hath performed this Mediation; And now let your hearts be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, — let your Hope be confirmed, — let your Love be confirmed, — let your Joy be confirmed, — let your Thankfulneſſe be confirmed, — let your Graces be confirmed. A confirmed Covenant, calls for confirmed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p>I have done, I cannot ſay whom we ſhould love moſt, and be thankful moſt unto, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or the Son; but this I ſay, love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all your heart, and be thankful to him, in reference to his Contrivance; — love the Son with all your heart, and be thankful to him in reference to his Performance, for <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> is the Mediator of the New Covenant.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And if you look into the 7th. of the <hi>Rom.</hi> you ſhall find that now in theſe Goſpel times, we are to be <hi>dead unto the Law;</hi> which the Apoſtle clears by a very great ſimilitude: Saith he, <hi>Know ye not Brethren, how that the Law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth: For the woman which hath an husband, is bound by the Law to her Husband, ſo long as he liveth; but if the Husband be dead, ſhe is looſed from the law of her Husband: So then, if while her husband liveth, ſhe be married to another man, ſhe ſhall be called an Adultereſs; but if her husband be dead, ſhe is free from that Law; ſo that ſhe is no Adultereſs, though ſhe be married to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man: Wherefore, my Brethren, ye alſo are become dead to the Luw, by the body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be marryed to another, even to him who is raiſed from the dead, that we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ye are married to another, therefore ye are dead to the Law— dead, how dead?— why, ye are <hi>freed from the Law;</hi> he expreſſes it ſo elſewhere, freed from the Law— How ſo?

               <p>And ye are free from the Covenant of the Law, as a Covenant. And thus are ye in theſe Goſpel times, dead to the Law, and free: But now though we are thus dead, and be thus free, yet poſſibly a man may be too Legal in theſe Goſpel times, That's the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>

Or, in ſhort, What is the Way and Spirit of the Old, and of the New Teſtament, and wherein do they differ?</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, An Old Teſtament legal Spirit, is a ſervile ſpirit, that ſerveth God upon the account of wages, or reward; moſtly, chiefly, or onely. An Evangelical Goſpel ſpirit, is a Filial ſpirit. <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore the Head of that Covenant, is called a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;</hi> and Jeſus the Head of this Covenant, is called a <hi>Son: Moſes as a Servant, Chriſt as a Son,</hi> Heb. 3.

               <p>Why, a Servant ſerves for wages, and a Son ſerves out of love and duty: And are there not many in theſe times of the Goſpel, that do <hi>ſerve God onely, or m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So then it ſeems, 'tis <hi>Heaven</hi> that is their meaſure of obedience— Why— becauſe men are legal, and ſerve God upon the account of wages: 'Tis Heaven, and Reward, and Wages, that's the buſineſs. Why, becauſe men are legal.</p>
               <p>I grant, It is lawful to have an eye to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Reward, Chriſt himſelf had. <hi>All love of reward is not Mercenary:</hi> But for a man to ſerve God, moſtly, chiefly, onely, upon the account of wages, and for reward, this is plainly Legal. <hi>A man of a Goſpel ſpirit, knows that he lives upon a better Purſe,

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:171186:65"/> part of the Chapter comes the Law, and the curſe. And if you look into this Scripture, you find the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference alſo: for ſaith the Apoſtle here, <hi>We are not come unto the Mount that might be touched, that burned with fire, nor unto blackneſs, and darkneſs, and tempeſt, and the ſound of a Trumpet, and the voice of words which they could not endure, ſo terrible was the ſight thereof: But ye are come to mount Sion.</hi> Would you know the difference between the diſpenſations? the one is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, the other comfortable. — The one is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the other comforting: Look in the 10th. of <hi>Rom.</hi> The Apoſtle there alſo makes the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Spirit of the Law and the Goſpel. <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>v.</hi> 5.) <hi>deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, that the man which doth thoſe things, ſhall live by them.</hi> Do, and live: but at the 6. verſe, <hi>The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is of Faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe, Say not in thine heart, who ſhall aſcend into Heaven; that is, to bring Chriſt down from above, or who ſhall deſcend into the deep.</hi> But what ſaith it, <hi>The Word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart.</hi> The Righteouſneſs which is of Faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe; ſay not in thine heart who ſhall aſcend into Heaven: It don't hold the ſoul in ſuſpence and anxiety, and fear, and trouble. <hi>Chriſt hath aſcended,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt hath deſcended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But you will ſay, May not a man that is of a Goſpel ſpirit, and that is come to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, be full of fears? May not a good and gratious ſoul be full of fears about his condition?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, He may; but his fears do ariſe from the weakneſs of his Adherence and Faith. The other's fears do rather ariſe from the weakneſs of the ground he ſtands upon. As for example: Two men are affraid of drowning; one ſtands upon a <hi>Rock,</hi> and he is affraid of being drown'd; the other ſtands
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:171186:65"/> upon a <hi>Quick-ſand,</hi> and he's affraid of being drown'd; both are affraid: He that ſtands upon a Rock, is affraid of drowning, why, becauſe he is affraid he ſhall be waſht off: His fear ariſes from the weakneſs of his Adherence: But the other's fear ariſes from the unſoundneſs of the ground he ſtands upon, for it is upon a Quick-ſand. So here, are two fears: a gracious Goſpel-heart fears, and a Legaliſt fears. <hi>One fears from the weakneſs of his Adherence; I am upon the Rock, but I am affraid I ſhall be waſht off: But the other's fears ariſe from the weakneſs of the ground he ſtands upon; he ſtands upon the Quick-ſand, upon his own duties, and his own works;</hi> ſo that a legal Spirit is a fearing Spirit: He is put on rather by the Threatnings, than the Promiſe: The other by the Promiſe, rather than the Threatning. <hi>The one is kept from evil by his delight in good, and the other is put on to good by his fear of evil:</hi> That's the ſecond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the times of the Old Teſtament, they did very much meaſure the love of God by outward things: For the Promiſes (as you know) then were moſtly concerning Temporal things; and ſo they meaſured the love of God much by thoſe outward things. But now in the times of the New Teſtament, our Promiſes are moſtly ſpiritual, and therefore a New Teſtament ſpirit, meaſures the love of God moſt by Spiritual things, and not by theſe outward things.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A legal Old Teſtament ſpirit, trades much, or moſt, or altogether, with conditional Promiſes; for the Old Covenant Promiſes were moſt condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and ran conditionally: But now when God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes the New Covenant, he gives out an abſolute Promiſe; and therefore a New Teſtament ſpirit trades much with abſolute promiſes. For he knows
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:171186:66"/> (and you may know) that though a promiſe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, the Lord hath promiſed the very condition in another Scripture, and that without a condition. And he knows (and you may know) that when God gives a promiſe with an Oath, though the promiſe do run conditionally, it ſhall be fulfilled abſolutely.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the time of the Old Teſtament, they came unto Chriſt by the promiſe, for Chriſt was not yet come, but promiſed: <hi>But now in the times of the New Teſtament, we come firſt to Chriſt, and ſo unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;</hi> for all the Promiſes are Yea, and Amen in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the time of the Old Teſtament, they came unto Chriſt by the Law, and, without the Law they might not come to Chriſt: <hi>For the Law was a School-maſter for to bring to Chriſt.</hi> But now in the time of the New Teſtament, <hi>The Law is not our School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for to bring to Chriſt.</hi> And though ſeldome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny go to Heaven, but come by the gates of Hell; And ſeldome men do come to Chriſt now, but they have ſome workings of the Law firſt: Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, if I will lay a neceſſity upon ſuch a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of a legal work, before I do come to Chriſt, then I am too legal.</p>

In the times of the Old Teſtament, men did then upon any great diſcovery of God, flie from God; as when God gave out the Law, they fled from God: And when Chriſt did a great work before <hi>Peter, Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>depart from me, for I am a ſinful man:</hi> But now in the Goſpel, the greater the diſcovery is, the more a Goſpel Spirit doth draw near to God: Oh, 'tis good for me to be here! ſaith he.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The time of the Old Teſtament, was a time of the Letter: And therefore if a man of a legal ſpirit, can but perform his duty according to the Letter of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:171186:66"/> the Commandment, he is ſatisfied. But the times of the New Teſtament, are the times of the Spirit: <hi>We are not Miniſters of the Letter, but of the Spirit:</hi> And therefore a Goſpel ſpirit, though he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his duty according to the Letter of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; yet if he don't attain the ſpirit in it, he is unſatisfied.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To ſay no more in it but this: In the times of the Old Teſtament God ſpake by Viſions, and Dreams, and Signs: <hi>But now in theſe latter days, he hath ſpoken by his Son; and we have a more ſure word of Propheſie, whereunto we do well that we take heed.</hi> So that thus you ſee that there is a difference, and what the difference is between the way of the Old, and New Teſtament, between an Old Teſtament, and a New Teſtament ſpirit.</p>

               <p>Much, very much: And I pray conſider it, that we may be all found upon Goſpel ground, in this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel day. Danger, I ſay, much. For,</p>
               <p n="1">I. The more legal you are in Goſpel times, the more ſinful you will be, and the leſs able for to live unto God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The more ſinful you will be: For ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Let not ſin reign in your mortal body, for ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the leſs able you will be to live unto God: For ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I through the Law, am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God.</hi> Till ye be <hi>dead</hi> unto the Law, you will never <hi>live</hi> unto God; and in the <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>Ye are become dead to the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:171186:67"/> Law, by the body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be married to another, even to him, who is raiſed from the dead, that we ſhould bring forth fruit untr God.</hi> Dead unto the Law, <hi>That</hi> ye may bring forth fruit unto God: Never think of bringing forth fruit unto God, while you are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a legal ground, and come not off fully to <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Mediator of the New Covenant.— 'Tis obſerved, that the Law was given out twice in Tables of Stone. And the firſt time that they were given out, God did cut out the Tables of Stone, and he himſelf did write the Law with his own Finger in thoſe Tables. The ſecond time <hi>Moſes</hi> cut out the Tables of Stone, and <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the words of the Commandment upon thoſe Tables. In the 34. of <hi>Exod. Hew thee two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Stone, like unto the firſt,</hi> ſaith God: Well, ſo he did: at the 28. <hi>v. And he wrote upon the Tables, the words of the Covenant, the Ten Commandments.</hi> The firſt Tables were of Gods own making, and the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was of Gods own Finger: The ſecond Tables were of <hi>Moſes</hi> framing, and <hi>Moſes</hi> writing, and yet the firſt were broken, the ſecond kept.— What ſhould be the Reaſon? One would think that the firſt Tables ſhould have been kept as a holy thing, rather then the ſecond; but the firſt were broken, and the ſecond kept— why— For a good reaſon, ſaith <hi>Auſtine,</hi> becauſe when the Commandment was given in the firſt Tables, then God appeared in a dreadful way, with Thundring and Lightning: When God gave out the Commandments again; the Lord appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a way of Grace: <hi>The Lord proclaimed unto Moſes,</hi> Exod 34. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands.</hi> Thus God proclaimes himſelf as a <hi>gracious and merciful God,</hi> and when the Law comes out now, 'tis kept. No ſuch way
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:171186:67"/> to keep the Commandments of the Law, as from the conſideration of the free grace and mercy of God. When the Law comes out with a Goſpel hand, I then it's kept, and the Commandment not broken. So that I ſay, the more Legal you are, the more ſinful you will be, and the leſs able you will be for to live unto God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The more Legal you are, the more oppoſite you are to your own aſſurance; to a full ſetled aſſurance of your intereſt in God and Chriſt: <hi>We have not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Spirit of bondage</hi> (you read it,) <hi>again to fear; but the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Aſſurance is a work of the Comforter; but the Spirit of ſervitude, 'tis oppoſite to the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby we cry, Abba, Father; 'tis a great Enemy unto true aſſurance. Now is it not a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing for a man or woman to be always fluctuating, and never to have aſſurance ſetled: The more Legal you are, the more oppoſite to your own aſſurance: But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though you do ſerve and worſhip the true God, yet if you worſhip him in a Legal way, your worſhip will be Antichriſtian — For what's <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and who is Antichriſt? — The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> tells you in the 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Every Spirit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is not of God; and this is that Spirit of Antichriſt, whereof you have heard that it ſhould come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſhall Antichriſt deny Chriſt to be come in the fleſh in ſo many terms? No,</p>
               <p>He ſhall not deny the Incarnation of Chriſt; for, he ſhall ſit in the Temple of God.</p>

               <p>As in the time of the Old Teſtament before Chriſt came in the fleſh, there was an outward, glorious, and a pompous Worſhip; ſo ſhall Antichriſt have.</p>
               <p>As in the time of the Old Teſtament before Chriſt came in the fleſh, there was a Temple, and a great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral; ſo ſhall Antichriſt have.</p>

               <p>As in the time of the Old Teſtament before Chriſt came in the fleſh, there were Copes, and Ephods, and Linnen Coats; ſo ſhall Antichriſt have.</p>

               <p>And as in the time of the Old Teſtament before Chriſt came in the fleſh, here were Sacrifices; ſo ſhall Antichriſt have his unbloody Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>As then, they turned into a Covenant of Works, ſo ſhall Antichriſt alſo do. Thus, the more Legal, and of an Old Teſtament ſtamp, your Worſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But yet, May not poſſibly a godly, truly gracious Soul, be too Legal, even in theſe Goſpel-times?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Poſſibly he may; for as there is no Duty which a good man doth perform, but a wicked man may perform the ſame for one Act; ſo there is no ſin that a wicked man doth commit, but a godly man may commit the ſame for one Act; and therefore this of <hi>Legality</hi> he may fall into as well as others.</p>
               <p>Yet let me tell you this, Though a good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul may be overgrown with Legality too much, yet he is very ſenſible of his own Legality; a meer Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galiſt is not, he thinks it ſtrange that we ſpeak of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Spirit in a Goſpel-time.</p>
               <p>And though a good man may be too much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown, be too Legal, and too Moſaical; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he doth not, he cannot, wiſh that there were
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:171186:69"/> no Law, becauſe the Law is written in his heart; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other that is under the power of the Law, could wiſh with all his Soul, that there were no Law, becauſe he is under the power of it.</p>
               <p>Again, Though a good man may be too much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with Legality, yet he doth moſt ſavour the things of the Goſpel, ſpiritual things: <hi>For every man is according to what he ſavours.</hi> Three men come to a Sermon — One's an Affectionate man — An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other an Expreſſionate man, a man of parts — An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other a Spiritual man; and the Preacher hath (it may be) all three. He hath Affection, he hath Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he hath Spiritual matter: The Affectionate man is moſt taken with the Affectionate part: The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſioniſt, and the man of parts, is moſt taken with the Expreſſions of the Sermon; and there he hangs, ſuch and ſuch rare Expreſſions there were — <hi>But the Spiritual man is moſt taken with the Spiritual matter of the Sermon; for every man is according to the things that he ſavours.</hi> Now, I ſay, a good man, though he may be overgrown with Legality, yet he ſavours ſpiritual and Goſpel-things moſt.</p>
               <p>And then again, Though a good man may be too Legal, yet notwithſtanding, he don't, he cannot, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe that are Spiritual, and Evangelical, and of a Goſpel Spirit. Though a ſpark of fire be not ſo great as the flame, it will not oppoſe the flame; and though a good man be too Legal, he will not oppoſe and perſecute them that are Evangelical, a Legaliſt will; ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>But the Son of the Bond-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, perſecuted the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:171186:69"/>
               <p>But <hi>Fifthly,</hi> What ſhall we then do, that we may ſtand clear from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and come off clearly unto <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> the Mediator of the New Covenant?</p>
               <p>This I muſt ſpeak unto: only by the way, give me leave to ſay three or four things unto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> If we are not come to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Mediator of the Old Covenant, but unto <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Mediator of the New; What a bleſſed, and happy condition are all the Saints in now in theſe Goſpel-times?

Friends, will you not be thankful for this Mediator, will ye return to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> now; what, having ſuch a Mediator, will ye now return to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and be legal now? Conſider what a bleſſed ſtate ye are now brought unto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, If we are now come unto Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and not unto <hi>Moſes: Why then ſhould we go to men for the Worſhip of God, and for the Ordinances of God?</hi> What, may we not have recourſe to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſhall we have recourſe to men? <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake from God, and ſpake the words of God unto the people; and, may we not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe now to <hi>Moſes</hi> for the Ordinances, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſhall we have recourſe to men for our Worſhip, and Ordinances? As <hi>Gerſom</hi> out of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> obſerves: One commandment from a fellow-ſervant, is more burthenſome then a hundred from the Maſter; and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake the words of God: If <hi>Moſes</hi> Tool doth defile our Chriſtian Altar, how much more doth the Tool of man defile our Altar? That's the ſecond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we be now come unto Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, why then ſhould we deſpair of any, and not go to God for the worſt of men, for we are come to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Mediator of the New Covenant. Mark, how i'ts brought in, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>— What then? <hi>I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort therefore that Supplications, Prayers, and Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be made for all men: For Kings.</hi> Even for <hi>Nero,</hi> a perſecutor. — Why? <hi>For there is one God and one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus:</hi>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:171186:71"/> And therefore you may go to God for the worſt of men, <hi>For there is one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Three ſorts there are that do greedily ſnatch at this Scripture.— The <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>— and the <hi>Arminian,</hi>— and the <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Socinian</hi> thinks that here is ſomething for him againſt the Deity of Chriſt, becauſe 'tis ſaid, the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Whereas in the 3d. verſe, it is ſaid, this is good and acceptable in the ſight of <hi>God our Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Arminian</hi> thinks there's ſome ground here for his Univerſal Redemption: For it's ſaid, There is one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſome for <hi>ALL:</hi> Whereas the Apoſtle here doth explain himſelf, what he means by this <hi>All;</hi> that is, all, both <hi>Iews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> For ſaith he in the next verſe, <hi>Whereunto I am ordained a Preacher, and an Apoſtle, a Teacher of the Gentiles, in Faith and Verity:</hi> Explaining his word <hi>All,</hi> to be meant both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> alſo think they have ſomething here for their Opinion, who hold that Chriſt is our Mediator onely according to his <hi>humane Nature:</hi> For it's ſaid, the <hi>man Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> But if we obſerve how theſe words are brought in; we find, it is an incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pray for the worſt of men.—Why— for there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Be not diſcouraged, go to God for the worſt of men,</hi> for there is one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But then fourthly, If we are come unto Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, why then, why ſhould you not come to Jeſus? If you be come, why ſhould you not come? That is, if you be come in regard of your ſtate, why ſhould you not come in regard of act, in a way of believing. You are
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:171186:71"/> come unto him in regard of your ſtate; why ſhould you not come unto him in regard of your faith, come unto him in a way of believing. Some think, oh 'tis preſumption to come to Chriſt, and to believe and lay hold on Chriſt: But friends, <hi>'Tis no preſumption for any man to do that act, that is ſutable to his ſtate;</hi> 'tis no preſumption to act according to my ſtate that God hath brought me to: Now this is our ſtate; in regard of <hi>ſtate,</hi> we are come to Jeſus, and therefore why ſhould we not come to Jeſus alſo in a way of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Eſpecially ſeeing he hath ſaid, <hi>Thoſe that come unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. If we be come unto Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and not unto <hi>Moſes:</hi> Why then ſhould we not all ſtand clear from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and come fully off to Jeſus, the Mediator of the New Covenant?</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, What ſhould we do that we may be found upon Goſpel grounds, with a Goſpel Spirit. I confeſs I have been too legal; legal in my perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, legal in my obedience, legal in the matter of my comfort; what ſhould I do now that I may ſtand clear from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and come fully off to <hi>Jeſus</hi> this Mediator of the New Covenant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Improve all your former legal workings and fears, unto your dying to them; improve them ſo as by them, to <hi>die</hi> to them. Many it may be of you here, have been under legal workings, and terrors: Either you have, or you have not; if you have not been under any legal workings or terror, thou art one of a hundred.</p>
               <p>If you have, why ſhould you not improve thoſe legal workings, ſo as by them, to <hi>die</hi> unto them: ſaith <hi>Paul, I through the Law, am dead unto the Law.</hi>— VVhat's that?— I through the Law, am dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Law, that I might live unto God. I through
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:171186:72"/> affliction, am dead unto my affliction.— I through the diſappointment of Friends, am dead unto my Friends.— I through ſin, am dead unto my ſin.— I through the Law, and the terrors of the Law, am dead unto the Law. Now then, Improve your former terrors, ſo as by them to die unto them. You have been under them: I, but have you improved them, have you ſo improved them, as thereby for to die unto them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve what thoſe things are that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Old-Teſtament, and go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Teſtament, for grace to perform them. There is nothing command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Old Teſtament, but it's promiſed in the New. There is nothing commanded by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Old Teſtament, but Chriſt the Mediator of the New Teſtament, is ingaged to perform it for you, and to give you grace to do it: The Law commands, and Grace helps: <hi>The Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth, comes by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Obſerve therefore, what that is that is commanded by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Old, and go to <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Mediator of the New, for Grace and Strength to do the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then be ſure that you ſtand when the Spirit breathes: Now the Spirit brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hes— in the pure and clean preaching of the Goſpel: <hi>Received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> VVould you be brought off from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſtand clear from <hi>Moſes;</hi> chooſe to ſtand under ſuch a Preaching, where the Spirit breathes, and that's a Goſpel Preaching.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then put your ſelves upon the ſtream of the free Grace of God, without having any foot on your own bottom: Some men will learn to ſwim, and they are loth to lean themſelves upon the ſtream of the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:171186:72"/> water, but keep a foot at the bottom; and they never learn to ſwim, till they take up the foot: Some would fain be Evangelical, but they cannot lean themſelves upon the ſtream of Grace, but keep a foot at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom ſtill, upon ſome thing of their own.</p>
               <p>Some there are that do, and work, and when they can work no further, then they eke it out with Chriſt's Mediation. <hi>So indeed they make the Mediation of Chriſt but an Eekment to their own working: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with theſe Eekments: Oh, let Chriſt be all, let Chriſt be all!</hi> And therefore,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Study much the body of Jeſus, and the allſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie of the Mediation of this Jeſus the Mediator of the Covenant: The ſight of Gods Alſufficiencie, will draw one off from the Creature: And the ſight of the Alſufficiencie of the Mediation of Chriſt, will draw one off from <hi>Moſes.</hi> Put thy ſelf often unto this Disjunction: Come O my ſoul, either there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the Mediation of Jeſus, or not: If not enough, why do I go unto Chriſt at all; if there be enough, why ſhould I not ſtand clear from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and upon pure Goſpel ground? Thus therefore do.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But, Suppoſe I have come to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, what ſhould I do that I may walk up unto this condition? What ſhould I do, and how ſhould I ſo walk, as one that is indeed come unto Jeſus, the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of the Covenant; that yet I may ſtand upon Goſpel ground, and not touch at all upon</hi> Moſes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, If you be indeed come unto Jeſus, this Mediator of the New Covenant, and would walk ſutably thereunto: VVhy then, ſhould you not ſtill throng and preſs after the Appointments, Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Ordinances of Jeſus? <hi>The Law and the Prophets were untill</hi> John, <hi>but from</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven ſuffers violence;</hi> that was ſutable to the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:171186:73"/> Goſpel.— And what was the ſuffering violence, but peoples preſſing after the Goſpel: So now, to preſs after the Kingdom of Heaven, ſuites with a Goſpel ſtate; to preſs after the Ordinances, and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Jeſus, ſuites with a Goſpel ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Labour more and more for to know your <hi>Chriſtian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iberty, in Conjunction with ſtrictneſs of life.</hi> Some there are that are very ſtrict in their lives, but they don't know their Chriſtian l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>berty; ſome again know their Chriſtian liberty, yet abate in their ſtrictneſs of life: But bleſſed is that knowledge of our Chriſtian liberty, that is in conjunction with more ſtrictneſs of life. Oh bleſſed! bleſſed is that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Chriſtian liberty, where ſtrictneſs of life, and holineſs, grow up together with it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, labour more and more to know your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty in conjunction with ſtrictneſs, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, this ſuites a Goſpel ſtate; then ſhall you do as thoſe that are come unto Jeſus. But then,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In regard of your Faith: Be ſure that you cloſe with Chriſt himſelf, the abſolute Promiſe; and live in continual dependence upon Chriſt, this Jeſus, this Mediator. For as living upon an old Stock, and a Stock received, ſuited with a covenant of works: So living in continual dependence upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus for freſh Grace, ſuites with this covenant of Grace whereof he is Mediator.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In regard of your repentance and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſin, the more your hearts do melt, and thaw under ſenſe of love, that you have ſin'd againſt God: For the Law rends and tears; but the Goſpel melts and thaws.— The more that you grieve for ſin, and rejoyce in God together.— The more you grieve for ſin that is pardoned, and <hi>becauſe</hi> 'tis pardoned: For a legal Spirit grieves for ſin, onely that it <hi>may</hi> be
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:171186:73"/> pardoned; but a Goſpel ſpirit <hi>becauſe it is</hi> pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.— And the more you grieve for ſins that are ſecret, the ſins of your ſpirits, eſpecially <hi>unbelief:</hi> For ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I ſay unto you, he that locketh upon a woman,</hi> &amp;c. The more I ſay you are found doing theſe things in reference to your Repentance, the more your Repentance ſuits with the Goſpel, and with a Goſpel ſtate. And then,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, As to the matter of your Obedience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The more gracious you are upon the account of Grace, the more Evangelical. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The more free you are in your actings towards God, the more Evagelical; thoſe that Jeſus makes free, are free indeed.— Free— Not <hi>from</hi> duty, but free <hi>in</hi> duty; free from ſin, but not free to ſin: A legal Spirit is reſtrained from evil, and conſtrained to good. Labour to be free in all your actings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. And,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then again, The more you are conformed unto God the Father who hath given you this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and to Jeſus this Mediator; the more Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical you are, and the more you ſuite with this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſtate unto which you are come.— Now a man is conformed unto God the Father, when he doth good to men for evil; Bleſs them that curſe you, ſo ſhall ye be the children of your Father.— Then a man is conformed to Jeſus this Mediator, when his life is inammeled with Meekneſs, and Humility; <hi>Learn of me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>for I am meek and lowly.</hi> Friends, the Law frets, and the Goſpel ſweetens.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And then, In caſe that you have to deal with the things of the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rld: The more you are eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the world by Faith, and can forſake the things thereof for Chriſt, and his Wayes, and Truth, bearing witneſs to his Truth and wayes; the more
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:171186:74"/> you comply and comport with a Goſpel ſtate: <hi>If thou wilt be perfect,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to that Legaliſt, <hi>go and ſell all that thou haſt, and come and follow me, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in Heaven.</hi> And,</p>
               <p>In caſe that you meet with ſufferings, look upon all your ſufferings as part of Chriſts purchaſe for you: Your ſufferings are your ſervants; for all things are yours; for you are Chriſts, who is the Head of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>And in caſe that you are under any ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, <hi>Then praiſe God for his love to Jeſus, when you cannot praiſe God for his love to you:</hi> A true Goſpel ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, will praiſe God the Father for his love to Chriſt his Son, when he cannot praiſe God for his love to himſelf, becauſe he wants aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Again, if you would yet walk up unto this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel (whereunto now we are come) then whatſoever you do, be ſure that you do it upon Goſpel Principles: Principles of Love, principles of Thankfulneſs, principles of Ingenuity: <hi>Principles are the ſprings of Actions:</hi> If your principles be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical, your actions will be Evangelical; if your principles be legal, your actions will be legal: Stock therefore, and ſtore your ſelves with Goſpel princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, principles of Love, principles of Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and principles of Ingenuity; doing all in the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> this Mediator of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>And when you have wrought, and done all, Reſt upon Jeſus this Mediator, as if you had done nothing: Yet repent, work and do, as if you had no ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: I ſay, <hi>Work, and pray, and read, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and confer, and repent, as if you had no Mediator for to reſt upon, but onely your works; and yet reſt upon this your Mediator, as if you had done no work at all:</hi> Thus do, and thus ſhall you comply and comport with your Goſpel ſtate.</p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:171186:74"/>
               <p>Which that you may do, conſider, This is that you are now called unto; you are now come to Jeſus, not to <hi>Moſes;</hi> you are now come to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant: VVhy then; As in the time of the Old Teſtament, they had recourſe unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo now in the times of the New Teſtament, ye are in all things to have recourſe unto Jeſus: VVhat ſaith Jeſus to this buſineſs? Here's VVorſhip, VVhat ſaith Jeſus to it? Here's an Ordinance, VVhat ſaith Jeſus to it? Here's an Officer of the Church, VVhat ſaith Jeſus to it? This is ſuitable unto the ſtate that now you are come unto.</p>
               <p>And thus ſhall all your Convictions, Graces, and your duties, be refined; you ſhall have much in a little room: A legal work may be great for the bulk, yet be but little; a Goſpel work though but little, hath a great deal in it, for 'tis refined.</p>
               <p>And thus alſo ſhall you have the wedding Garment on: For pray, What is the wedding Garment, but a Goſpel diſpoſition, ſutable to a Goſpel diſpenſation; this is the wedding Garment. Not Faith, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, nor this, nor that particular Grace, <hi>But a Goſpel diſpoſition, ſutable to a Goſpel diſpenſation, is the wedding Garment;</hi> and thus ſhall you be cloathed with it.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo your <hi>Onely</hi> ſhall ſtand in its proper place: For mark where the Apoſtle places your <hi>onely; Onely,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let your Converſation be as it becomes the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;</hi> there ſtand a <hi>Chriſtians onely,</hi> upon a converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becoming the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo ſhall you pleaſe the Father: The more that you come to Jeſus the Mediator, whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath appointed: And the more your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſuites thereunto, the more you pleaſe the Father: You can never pleaſe the Father more, than in coming to the Son.</p>
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:171186:75"/>
               <p>Now therefore, as ever you do deſire that you may pleaſe the Father;</p>
               <p>As you do deſire, that your <hi>onely</hi> may be found in the right and proper place;</p>
               <p>As you do deſire, that you may be found having the wedding Garment on:</p>
               <p>As you do deſire, that all your Convictions, Graces, Duties, may be more refined, and ſo preſerved and kept:</p>
               <p>As you do deſire, to be found doing according to the ſtate whereunto you are called; ſo let it be your work, your and buſineſs, to ſtand clear from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to ſtand upon clear Goſpel ground, and to come off fully unto Jeſus the Mediator of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: For, ſaith this Doctrine, In theſe Goſpel times, we are not come unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Mediator of the Old Teſtament, or of the Old Covenant, but unto Jeſus, the Mediator of the New Covenant: And ſo I have done with this third Obſervation. There is a fourth thing yet behind, which concerns the Blood of Sprinkling, that ſpeaketh better things than the blood of <hi>Abel.</hi>

This is he that came by Water and Blood, even Jeſus Chriſt; not by Water onely, but by Water and Blood.</hi> Again, This is he, even Jeſus Chriſt, that came by water and blood: which blood of Sprinkling, is the blood of Jeſus, ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> expreſly, in his 1 Epiſt. 1.2. <hi>Elect according to the foreknowledge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>f God the Father, through ſanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and ſprinkling of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> So that plainly then, and briefly, this <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>od of Sprinkling,</hi> in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto thoſe Types and Ceremonies of ſprinkling blood, in the time of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>For our better underſtanding whereof, I ſhall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſhew you briefly, what were the grounds and reaſons of their ſprinkling blood, in the times of the Old Teſtament, and how that is appliable to the blood of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>If you look therefore into the Old Teſtament, you
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:171186:76"/> ſhall find that they ſprinkled blood upon a fourfold account.</p>
               <p>To confirm and ratifie the Covenant between God and them.</p>
               <p>To make an Attonement for their ſin.</p>
               <p>For the ſanctification, and purification of their Perſons and things.</p>
               <p>And for the preſervation of their Perſons.</p>
               <p>Accordingly therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19. the <hi>Book</hi> was ſprinkled: ſo in the 24. of <hi>Exod.</hi> the meaning of it is given, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>And he took the Book of the Covenant, and read in the audience of the people, and they ſaid, all that the Lord hath ſaid, we will do, and be obedient; and</hi> Moſes <hi>took the blood, and ſprinkled it on the people, and ſaid, behold the blood of the Covenant:</hi> and the 9th of the <hi>Heb.</hi> tells us, That he ſprinkled the Book it ſelf; — And why ſo? — But to ſhew thus much, That it is the Blood of Jeſus that doth ratifie and confirm the Covenant now made, between God and us; as at large in that 9th of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Then alſo in thoſe times of the Old Teſtament, they ſprinkled blood, to make an Attonement for the ſins of the people; as you have it in the 4th of <hi>Levit.</hi> 6, and the 20. verſes. <hi>And the Prieſt ſhall dip his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the blood, and ſprinkle of the blood ſeven times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, before the Vail of the Sanctuary.</hi> The <hi>Mercy Seat,</hi> and the <hi>Altar,</hi> were ſprinkled;—the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is given at the 20 <hi>v.</hi> And he ſhall do with the Bullock, as he did with the Bullock for a fin offering, ſo ſhall he do with this: And, <hi>The Prieſt ſhall make an Attonement for them; and it ſhall be forgiven them.</hi> And why ſo? But to ſhew that it is the blood of Jeſus, whereby we have Attonement, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, In the times of the Old Teſtament, they did ſprinkle blood for the purification of mens <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:171186:77"/> and of <hi>Things.</hi> As you have it in <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>And he ſhall ſprinkle upon him that is to be cleanſed from the Leproſie ſeven times, and ſhall pronounce him clean.</hi> And why ſo? But to ſhew that it is the blood of Jeſus that doth cleanſe us from all Iniquity, as in the firſt Epiſt. of <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then in thoſe times, they did ſprinkle mens perſons, for preſervation from the deſtroying Angel: when the deſtroying Angel came to deſtroy the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> the poſts of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſprinkled, that they might be preſerved. — And why? But to ſhew that it is by the blood of Jeſus, that we are preſerved from the deſtroyer. In the 1. <hi>v.</hi> of the 1. of <hi>Jude,</hi> its ſaid, <hi>Jude</hi> the ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, and Brother of <hi>James,</hi> to them that are ſanctified by God the Father, and <hi>preſerved in Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> or preſerved <hi>by</hi> Jeſus Chriſt: and <hi>Chriſt our paſsover is ſacrificed for us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> So that thus now you ſee briefly, what were the grounds and reaſons of their ſprinkling blood, in the times of the Old Teſtament, and how all this is applicable to the Blood of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>And if you look wiſhly into the Scripture, and compare things with things, you ſhall find that <hi>Moſes</hi> in the times of the Old Teſtament, did divide the blood of the Covenant, part whereof was ſprinkled upon the Altar, poured down at the foot of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, to oblige God to the Covenant. — And part of it was ſprinkled upon the people, to confirm their ſouls in the certainty of the Covenant, and to oblige them to obſerve and keep Covenant with God. So, with the blood of Chriſt. And therefore when our Lord and Saviour Chriſt ſpeaks at the Lords Supper, he ſaith, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my blood, ſhed for many, for the Remiſſion of ſins.</hi> The firſt part
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:171186:77"/> part of the words: <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my blood,</hi> hath regard to us, ſhewing that our ſouls are to be confirmed in this, that we are in covenant with God.— The ſecond part of the words, <hi>ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> relates unto God, ſhewing the uſe of Chriſts blood, to ſatisfie God for our ſins, and to obtain our Remiſſion.</p>
               <p>And if you would know, What is the uſe of this Sprinkling; I ſay, Sprinkling of the Blood; notes <hi>Application:</hi> What are we the better for the Blood of Chriſt, if it be not applyed to us, and ſprinkled on us. There are two great Attributes of God, that we have to deal withal, in the great matter of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.— The <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God— and the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God. That the Juſtice of God might be be ſatisfied; Chriſt was made a ſacrifice on the Croſs, and his blood ſhed on Earth, that the favour of God might be obtained: Chriſt carries (as our great High-prieſt) his Blood, (the vertue of it) into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſprinkles the Mercy-ſeat ſeven times.</p>
               <p>And that we might be ſanctified, and reconcil'd to God, this Blood is ſprinkled upon us too. As it's ſprinkled upon the Altar, and the Mercy-ſeat, that God might be reconciled to us; ſo 'tis ſprinkled upon us, that we might be ſanctified &amp; reconciled to God: And that thereby we might be aſſur'd that God is in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us. As when the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſprinkled with blood, the Prieſt ſaying, <hi>This is the Blood of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> they were aſſured thereby, that they were in covenant with God: So when we are ſprinkled with the blood of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> we are, or may be, aſſured that we are in the covenant of Grace with God. And thus now you ſee, what this Blood of Sprinkling is,— upon what account 'tis ſprinkled,— and what is the uſe of the ſprinkling thereof. And ſo I
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:171186:78"/> have done with the firſt General.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Blood of Sprinkling (which is the blood of Ieſus) is a ſpeaking Blood, and ſpeaketh better things than that of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>el,</hi> or than <hi>Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſpeaketh, in regard of its continual, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Virtue, and Operation: But here are two things,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What this Blood of Sprinkling ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How, and in what ſenſe, it ſpeaketh better things than that of <hi>Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What this Blood of Sprinkling ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſpeaketh a neceſſity of ſatisfaction, for, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood there is no Remiſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſpeaketh the Righteouſneſs of God: If God have burnt down ſuch a City as this, to declare his Righteouſneſs; how much more doth the ſhedding of the blood of Ieſus, declare the Righteouſneſs of God: <hi>To declare, I ſay, his Righteouſneſs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſpeaketh the higheſt Obedience, that ever the Sun ſaw. That the Son of God ſhould be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto death, laying down his blood, is the higheſt Obedience. As the diſobedience of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> was in the matter of the <hi>Tree;</hi> ſo the obedience of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> was in the matter of the <hi>Tree: Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body, on the Tree,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.— As the diſobedience of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> was in the tranſgreſſing a poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, which was the ſymbol of obedience to the whole Moral Law: So the <hi>obedience</hi> of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> doth conſiſt in being <hi>obedient</hi> unto a poſitive command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was the ſymbol of his obedience to the whole Law of God: <hi>This c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mmandment received I of my Father,</hi> ſaith he.— And as <hi>Moſes</hi> the Head of that Covenant, was <hi>faithful in all his houſe;</hi> in ſo much
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:171186:78"/> as its ſaid of him, <hi>As the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rd Commanded, ſo did he:</hi> ſo <hi>Jeſus</hi> the head of this ſecond Covenant was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all his truſt, and as the Lord Commanded ſo did he, <hi>As the Father gave me commandment,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>even ſo I do, John.</hi> 14. laſt. So that the blood of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſpeaks the higheſt obedience in the World,</p>
               <p n="4">4. It ſpeaketh alſo the worth of ſouls, If a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian have a Patient ready to die, and nothing will work his cure but the heart-blood of the Phyſitian, and the Phyſitian ſhould vouchſafe thereto, and let him have his heart-blood to drink; Would it not argue that the Phyſitian thinks this mans life is of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment and of great worth, ſo 'tis here. And what doth this argue but that Jeſus did look upon the ſouls of men, as of Infinite worth and Concernment.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This blood of Jeſus, and the blood of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſpeaketh the evill of ſin: The hainouſneſs, the ſinfulneſs, the evill, of ſin. There are many things that do ſpeak the evill of ſin, but of all things methinks the blood of ſprinkling, the blood of Jeſus, ſpeaks the evill of ſin loudeſt; Give me leave to name ſome, that ſo you may compare them and this together.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ſeparation from God, and union with Satan, ſpeakes the evill of ſin. As by Grace we are united unto God, made One with God, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Devil: ſo by ſin we are ſeparated from God, and united unto Satan, and made one with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Condemnation of the whole World by the ſin of Adam, ſpeaks the evill of ſin: If the eating of the Apple, committing that <hi>one</hi> ſin, brought Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation upon <hi>all the World,</hi> how g eat muſt the evil of ſin be!</p>
               <p n="3">3. The fire of Hell ſpeaks the evil of ſin, for what is the fewel that the fire of hell feeds upon, but <hi>ſin;</hi> take ſin away, and the fire of Hell will die, it will be quencht.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:171186:79"/>4. The ſpoyl of Dutyes ſpeaks it: <hi>One</hi> ſinful <hi>thought,</hi> is enough to ſpoyl a prayer, to ſpoyl a Duty, to ſpoyl a Sermon: And if one drop of Inke ſhall black a whole Glaſs of milk, how black is that Inke!</p>
               <p n="5">5. The horror of Conſcience ſpeaks it; for, If but <hi>one ſin</hi> ſet on upon the ſoul by God, doth put a man into ſuch horror of Conſcience, how great is the evil of ſin!</p>
               <p n="6">6. The troubleſomneſs of the relicks of ſin in the Saints ſpeaks it: Sins in the Saints are but waſps without their ſting, And if the waſps without their ſting be ſo troubleſom, how troubleſom are the waſps that have their ſtings in them; how trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom is ſin in it ſelf!</p>
               <p n="7">But ſeventhly, and above all, The Blood of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſpeaks the evill of ſin. For if the <hi>guilt of</hi> ſin be ſo great that nothing can ſatisfie for it, but the Blood of Jeſus, and the <hi>Filth</hi> of ſin be ſo great that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can fetch out the ſtain thereof, but the blood of Jeſus, How great, How hainous, How ſinfull muſt the evil of ſin be? The Blood of ſprinkling ſpeakes the evil of ſin: And then</p>
               <p n="6">6ly As the Blood of ſprinkling ſpeaks the evil of ſin, ſo it ſpeakes the riches and the freeneſs of the Love of God. 'Twas love in <hi>Jonathan</hi> to part with his <hi>Garment</hi> for <hi>David,</hi> What love is it in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to part <hi>with</hi> his <hi>Blood</hi> for <hi>us?</hi> It was love that made Chriſt <hi>weep</hi> over <hi>Lazarus,</hi> They ſaid, <hi>Behold how he loved him!</hi> And if his <hi>Tears</hi> ſpeak his love, what doth his <hi>Blood?</hi> 'Tis love to give <hi>a cup of cold water</hi> to a <hi>Diſciple,</hi> what is it then to give ones <hi>warm Blood</hi> unto <hi>Enemies,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three things there are that do make a gift greatly free. 1. The greatneſs of the gift given,</p>
               <p>— 2. The unworthineſs of the Perſon given unto</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:171186:79"/>3. And the greatneſs of the perſon that gives.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for the gift it ſelf, What greater than the Blood of Jeſus?</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the Perſons given unto, who more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy then ſinfull men?</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for the Perſon that doth give, who greater then God in the three Perſons? The <hi>Father</hi> gives <hi>Chriſt</hi> to die: The <hi>Son</hi> dies and gives his Blood: And the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> comes and ſprinkles it; for it is the work of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> to ſprinkle: this is another thing that the Blood of Jeſus ſpeaks; It ſpeakes the Riches and the freeneſs of the love of God: theſe are the things that this blood of ſprinkling ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>And now if you ask, How, and in what reſpects it ſpeaketh better things than <hi>Abel,</hi> or then that of <hi>Abel:</hi> (For it may be tranſlated both ways according to the ſeveral copies, But take it according to our tranſlation: better than that of <hi>Abel,</hi> or then the blood of <hi>Abel.</hi>) How and in what reſpects doth the blood of Jeſus ſpeak better things than the blood of <hi>Abel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why it ſpeaks better things than the Perſonal blood of Abel — And it ſpeakes better things than the Sacrificed blood of Abel.</p>
               <p>It ſpeakes better then the Perſonal blood of Abel: for the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> cryed for <hi>vengeance</hi> againſt his <hi>own Brother,</hi> But the blood of <hi>Jeſus</hi> cries for <hi>mercy</hi> and for <hi>remiſſion</hi> for his <hi>Enemyes: Father forgive them they know not what they do,</hi> ſaid Chriſt when their hands were imbrewed in his blood:</p>
               <p>But others think rather that theſe words are to be underſtood of the ſacrificed blood of <hi>Abel.</hi> And becauſe <hi>Abel</hi> is the firſt that ſtands upon record in Scripture for offering a ſacrifice with blood, It is as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, The ſacrifice of Jeſus on
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:171186:80"/> the Croſs, and the blood of Jeſus, ſpeaketh better things than the ſacrifice of <hi>Abel,</hi> or of all the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Old-Teſtament. And Indeed, This is more ſutable to the ſcope of the Apoſtle here; For the deſign of the Apoſtle here, is, to ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of New-Teſtament ſacrifice, and of the way of the New-Teſtament, above the Old. And if you look into the Scripture you find, that though in the Fourth of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And would you know how the blood of Jeſus ſpeaketh better things than the ſacrificed blood of Abel, or than all the ſacrifices of the old Teſtament. Thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The blood of Jeſus, and the ſacrifice of Chriſt on the Croſs, doth give efficacie unto all thoſe ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: What a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e all the Types and Ceremonies, but dead things without the thing Typified?</p>
               <p n="2">2. And though <hi>Abel</hi> offered an excellent ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he did not offer his <hi>own Blood:</hi> But <hi>Jeſus did;</hi> he offered up himſelf by the Eternal Spirit, as in the 9th of the <hi>Heb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And though <hi>Abel,</hi> and the Fathers of the Old Teſtament offered excellent ſacrifices, yet they offered often, and ſo thoſe ſacrifices could not make the Commers thereunto perfect, ſaith the Apoſtle, But <hi>Chriſt</hi> offered himſelf <hi>once for all.</hi> And ſo he hath for ever perfected them that are ſanctified. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:171186:80"/>4. Though <hi>Abel</hi> and the Fathers in the Old Teſtament did offer excellent ſacrifices, yet their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was after their ſin committed; when they had commited a ſin, then they were to get a ſacrifice, and poſſibly they might have died before the ſacrifice; was offered: but the ſacrifice of Chriſt is, <hi>before</hi> our ſin is committed; we cannot die between the ſin and the ſacrifice.</p>

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:171186:81"/> and Glory. When Chriſt comes the ſecond time we ſhall be under Glorious diſpenſations, but now we are under the firſt Coming of Chriſt, and therefore what is the Diſpenſation that now we are under, but the diſpenſation of a crucified Chriſt?—What doth a Preaching ſignifie and hold forth, but Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? <hi>We Preach Chriſt crucified,</hi> ſaith, the Apoſtle— What do the Sacraments hold forth, why: <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood,</hi> ſaith he. So that now we are under the Diſpenſation of a crucified Chriſt. In the times of the Old Covenant, they did believe in God, and God himſelf was the firſt object of their Faith, and ſo they came to Chriſt: now, in theſe times of the New Teſtament, the firſt and immediat object of our Faith, is the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Faith in the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> Rom: 3. So that (I ſay) It is the blood of Jeſus that now we are come unto.</p>
               <p>Well but though in theſe Goſpel-times we are now come to the blood of Jeſus, the blood of ſprinkling; yet, it may be, this blood of ſprinkling may not be ſprinkled upon my ſoul. When may the blood of ſprinkling be ſaid to be ſprinkled upon a mans ſoul? How ſhall I know, whether this blood of ſprinkling be ſprinkled upon my ſoul in particular; that's a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of great Concernment: Thus therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it be your great work in all your Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and upon all Occaſions to apply your ſelves unto the blood of Jeſus, then is the blood of Jeſus applyed to you, and ſo ſprinkled on you: The blood of Jeſus is ſprinkled on us by the Spirit of God, and when it's ſprinkled by the Spirit of God, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. If you do make applications of your ſelves to Chriſt, certainly Chriſt hath made applications of Himſelf to you: for all our grace is but a reflexion of his Grace; we love him, becauſe he loved us
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:171186:82"/> firſt, and we chooſe him becauſe he choſe us firſt, and we apply our ſelves to him, becauſe he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed himſelf unto us firſt. If therefore in all Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and upon all occaſions, it be your great work to make an application of your ſelves unto the blood of Jeſus, then hath the blood of Jeſus been applyed to you, and ſprinkled upon you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you ever have had ſuch a ſight of the blood of Chriſt, as that thereby you are purged from an evil Conſcience, Then hath this blood been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to, and ſprinkled on you; They go together. In the 10th <hi>Heb.</hi> 22, its ſaid, Let us draw neer with a true heart, in full aſſurance of Faith, having our hearts <hi>ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience,</hi> or <hi>purged:</hi> (the 9th of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> calls it <hi>purged;</hi>) having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience. What is that? why an evil Conſcience is an evil Conſcience two wayes — either becauſe it is a ſluggiſh Conſcience, and don't ſtirr us up unto our duty, and accuſe for ſin; — or elſe becauſe it is a cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and deſpondent Conſcience. Now if you have had ſuch a ſight of the blood of Jeſus as hath quickned your Conſcience, and wakened your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and yet pacified your Conſcience at the ſame time, Then have you been ſprinkled with this blood of Jeſus. You ſee how they go together, in the 10th Chap. 1.2, 3. <hi>v.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you have a continual ſight and remembrance of the blood of Ieſus in all your goings out, and your comings in, Then hath the blood of Ieſus, been ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled upon you: When the deſtroying Angel paſſed over the houſes of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the <hi>Poſts</hi> were ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with the blood of the Lamb: The <hi>Poſts;</hi> And why their <hi>Poſts?</hi> But that in all their goings out, and their comings in, they might have an eye thereunto:
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:171186:82"/> So now, how is it with me? Do I, not onely find the virtue of the Lord Chriſt within me? But that in all my goings out, and comings in, I have an eye unto his blood; then is his blood ſprinkled upon my poſts, and applied unto me.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If that you do walk in the Light, as God is in the Light; then the blood of Ieſus hath been, and is, ſprinkled upon you, and applied to you: 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>But if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have fellowſhip one with another, and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi>— If we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light?— What's that?— How is God and Chriſt in the Light;— why he is in the Light certainly, in regard of Grace and Holineſs. So he is in the Light, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks here: <hi>So then, Although you cannot walk in the Light of Comfort, but as a child of Light walking in darkneſs; yet if you do walk in the Light of Holineſs,</hi> walk in the Light, as God is in the Light; then certainly, the blood of Ieſus Chriſt hath cleanſed you, and ſo hath been ſprinkled upon you.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you are indeed ſeparated and ſet apart for God, and for the Work and Service of God, then is the blood of Ieſus ſprinkled upon you: He that is dipt in this bloud of ſprinkling, is ſeparated. You ſhall obſerve, that when the Prieſts were Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the tip of the right Ear was ſprinkled with bloud, and the Thumb of the right hand, and the Toe of the right Foot:— And not onely the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> when they were conſecrated were ſo ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: But when a <hi>man was cleanſed from his Leproſie,</hi> he was ſo ſprinkled alſo.

And of the reſt of the Oyl that is in his hand, ſhall the Prieſt put upon the tip of the right Ear of him that is to be cleanſed, and upon the Thumb of his right hand, and upon the great Toe of his right Foot, upon the blood of the Treſpaſs-offering:</hi> And ſo in regard of Blood, as well as of Oyl — what's the meaning of this, that the tip of the right ear was to be toucht with bloud, and the thumb of the right hand was to be touched with bloud; and the toe of the right foot with bloud, both when the Prieſt was conſecrated, and when the Leproſie was cleanſed? But to ſhew thus much, That the whole man is to be ſet a part for God.— The Ear of his underſtanding and knowing part, is to be ſet aſide for God. — The Thumb of his hand, the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving part, (by Faith we lay hold) is to be ſet apart for God.— And the great Toe of the right foot, the Practical part of life and converſation: The whole man is to be ſet apart for God, where this ſprinkling comes: So that look therefore, when a man is ſet apart for the Worſhip and Service of God, Ear, and Hand, and Foot, ſet a part for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service of God; then he is ſaid to be ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with this blood of Sprinkling.</p>

And is this a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth thing tells us, It is a priviledge, and a very great priviledge to come unto the bloud of ſprinkling; it is a very great priviledge, to be ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with this bloud of Sprinkling.</p>
               <p>It was a very great priviledge for the <hi>Jews,</hi> to have a ſacrifice by them at hand, when they had committed ſin, to have the bloud of ſprinkling by them.— But alas, what's that to this, what was that ſacrifice to this of Chriſt, and what was that bloud to this of Chriſt; and what was that ſprinkling unto this ſprinkling of the bloud of Jeſus? Look what difference is between the Type, and the thing Typified.— Look what difference there is between the bloud of Bulls and Goats, and the bloud of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.— Look what difference between Carnal, and Spiritual things; ſo great a difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the coming to the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the coming to, and being ſprinkled with the bloud of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Let me open this a little to you, if you be indeed come unto this blood of ſprinkling, and be ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the blood of Jeſus;</p>

               <p n="14">14. And if you be indeed ſprinkled with the bloud of Jeſus, then may you go away, and ſay; Now are all the bleſſings of the Covenant mine: The day that you are ſprinkled with the bloud of Ieſus, you may ſay; now know I, that my ſins are pardoned: Mercy is mine, and Pardon is mine, and Adoption is mine. As, when the Pſalmiſt had a ſight of God, he cried

               <p>Firſt of all you muſt know, That there is a two-fold ſprinkling, with the bloud of Sprinkling.— There is an Initial ſprinkling,— and a Renewed ſprinkling: As there is an Initial Repentance, and a Renewed Repentance; ſo there is an Initial Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and a Renewed Sprinkling.</p>
               <p>An Initial ſprinkling, and that's a mans firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, when he is juſtified, according to that in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but you are waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Here's the Initial ſprinkling.</p>

It relates to the waſhings in the Old Teſtament: when the Prieſts were to come to offer a ſacrifice, there was a Laver, and they were then to waſh themſelves; ſo, ſaith the Apoſtle, let us draw neer to God, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water; becauſe upon a new addreſs to God, a freſh ſprinkling with the blood of Jeſus is to be had. 'Tis not enough to have an old ſprinkling with the blood of Jeſus, but upon all our approaches to God, eſpecially after ſome great ſin committed, or ſome ſpecial duty to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we muſt come and get a freſh ſprinkling with the blood of Jeſus.</p>

Be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, nor Effeminate, nor Abuſers of themſelves with man-kind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, ſhall inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. And ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:171186:86"/> waſhed,</hi> —how?— why <hi>ye are juſtified in the name of our Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God,</hi> which ſprinkles, which applies the blood of Chriſt: So then, though ye have bin great ſinners, yet you are not uncapable of being ſprinkled with this blood of ſprinkling.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You muſt know this alſo, that there is nothing on this ſide the blood of Jeſus, this blood of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that can cleanſe you: If any thing ſhould bid for our cleanſing, methinks it ſhould be our ſufferings and perſecutions for the name of God; but look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the 7th <hi>Rev.</hi> 14th it's ſaid, <hi>Theſe are they which came out of great Tribulations, and have waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb.</hi> — They have waſhed their Robes, —how? what, <hi>with their great Tribulations?</hi> — No, They came out of great Tribulations, but their Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions dont waſh them: theſe are they that came out of great Tribulation, and have waſhed their robes and made them white <hi>in the blood of the Lamb.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on this ſide Chriſt, and this blood of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, can cleanſe your ſouls. But,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though there be nothing on this ſide Chriſt that can cleanſe your ſouls, but the blood of Jeſus, yet it is the Spirit of Chriſt that muſt ſprinkle it. The blood of Jeſus is then ſprinkled, when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: now this is the work of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>I will ſprinkle you with clean water,</hi> I le waſh you with water? As it is a derogation to the blood of Chriſt to go to any elſe for cleanſing; So <hi>'tis a derogation to the Spirit of Chriſt to go to any elſe for ſprinkling, or to go to any elſe for that application of the Blood of Chriſt.</hi> 'Tis onely the Spirit of Chriſt that muſt ſprinkle this blood upon your and my ſoul.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though this ſprinkling muſt be done only by

You may obſerve therefore, that the ſame words that were uſed in the Old Teſtament when they ſprinkled the blood, <hi>This is the blood of the Covenant,</hi> as in the 9th of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> are uſed by our Saviour Chriſt at the Lords Supper: <hi>This Cup is the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament in my blood, &amp;c.</hi> Why ſo? but to ſhew thus much, that this ordinance of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> is the Hyſop in the hand of the Spirit, whereby the ſouls of believers are ſprinkled with a freſh ſprinkling: Oh therefore who would not come to this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the <hi>Lords ſupper</hi> in a right <hi>way</hi> and <hi>manner.</hi>

Now therefore, do you deſire that you may be ſprinkled with this blood of ſprinkling? then, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you go to the blood of Jeſus, and look upon it, go with the greateſt ſenſe of your unworthineſs of this blood; then go to the Spirit of God (whoſe work alone it is) to apply and ſprinkle, and then ſtand and wait where the Spirit ſtands with his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop</hi> to ſprinkle the ſouls of men: and ſo ſhall you be made partakers of this great priviledge.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that I be ſprinkled with the blood of Jeſus, and that this blood of ſprinkling hath indeed fallen upon my ſoul, what is my duty then?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, <hi>Go away and doubt no more.</hi> When the ſinning Jew was ſprinkled, do you think he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether he were pardoned or no? No ſurely, he did believe that he was pardoned, and that he was in Covenant with God. For thoſe words were uſed, <hi>This is the Blood</hi> of the Covenant. And ſhall you be ſprinkled with the blood of Jeſus, and will you doubt whether you be in Covenant with the Lord by Grace or no? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This blood of ſprinkling ſpeaketh, and you have heard what it ſpeaks; — now then I pray take heed that you don't refuſe him that ſpeaketh from <hi>Heaven;</hi> mark how it follows, in the very next words to the

See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh, for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpoke on Earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from Heaven.</hi> Why man or woman!

               <p>And ſecondly; Then alſo conclude and ſay; Now know I that I ſhall be preſerved from the deſtroyer. When the Iſralites poſts were ſprinkled with the blood of the Lamb, They could ſay; Now know I that I ſhall not be deſtroyed by this deſtroying Angel? Art thou ſprinkled with the blood of Jeſus, ſay then: Now know I that I ſhall not be deſtroyed, but that the Angel ſhall paſs over me in the deſtroying day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then alſo go away and be Contented with your Condition what ever it be: And well you may, if you be ſprinkled with the blood of Jeſus you are made partakers of the greateſt priveledg that can be, and will you not then be contented with your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? Go away and be contented with your Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſaying I have now received the greateſt prive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, for I am ſprinkled with the blood of Jeſus. therefore will I be contented with my Condition? What ever it be.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And then go away and praiſe God, and be very thankful; Be very thankful to God the Father, and to the Lamb with whoſe blood you are ſprinkled. Look into the 5th <hi>Rev.</hi> and you ſhall find, there are 3 quires of Praiſers, and all praiſing upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this blood: And when he had opened the book, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>the</hi> 24. <hi>Elders fell down before the Lamb,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:171186:88"/> and they ſung a new ſong:</hi> The four and twenty Elders (theſe are men) ſaying, <hi>Thou art worthy to take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof, for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood:</hi> By thy bloud, here's the foot of the Song.</p>
               <p>Then comes in the Angels, another Quire, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>And I beheld, and I heard the Voice of many Angels round about the Throne, and the Beaſts, and the Elders, and the number of them was ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands, ſaying with a loud voices; Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain;</hi> ſee the foot of the ſong ſtill, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain.</hi> Men praiſe upon this account, Angels praiſe upon this account alſo.</p>
               <p>There's a third Quire, and thoſe are other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>And every Creature which is in Heaven, and on the Earth, and under the Earth, and ſuch as are in the Sea, and all that are in them, heard I, ſaying; Bleſſing, Honour, Glory, and Power, be unto him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb:</hi> The word <hi>ſlain</hi> is not there, but <hi>to the Lamb,</hi> that's all one: Now ſhall there be ſuch praiſing God upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>for the Lambs being ſlain.</hi> And are you indeed moſt concerned, and ſprinkled with this blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, this Lamb, and will not you praiſe God? O! Go away, and be for ever thankful!</p>
               <p n="5">5. Go away and ſin no more: Be not defiled with ſin, for you ſee it coſt dear to cleanſe you. The bloud of Sprinkling, the bloud of Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And go away and honour God, yet more in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. It may be there are ſome here, that never honoured God to this day, with a believing ſmile: Man, Woman, art thou ſprinkled, indeed ſprinkled with the bloud of Jeſus? Go away then, and honour the Lord, <hi>with one ſmile of Faith this day.</hi>

               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:171186:88"/>7. And to conclude all, Art thou indeed ſprinkled with the bloud of Jeſus; then go away, and be ſure that you never ſell your Birth-right, for a meſs of Pottage: Mark, how this Text comes in. In this 12 of the <hi>Heb.</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaking of prophane <hi>Eſau: Take heed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>leſt there be any Fornicator, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſon, as</hi> Eſau, <hi>who for one morſel of meat, ſold his Birth-right: For ye know how that afterwards, when he would have inherited the bleſſing, he was rejected, for he found no place of Repentance, though he ſought it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with tears; for ye are not come to Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>but ye are come to Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and ye are come to Jeſus, the Mediator of the Covenant, and to the bloud of Sprinkling.</hi> What then? O! Take heed you do not ſell your Birth-right, for a meſs of Pottage!— What is your Birth-right? The Goſpel is your Birth-right, you are born there-to (through Grace:) And, <hi>What is your little eſtate, but a meſs of Pottage; and what is your great eſtate, but a great boul of Pottage.</hi> O! Do not ſell your birth-right for a meſs of Pottage. You are ſprinkled, and the bloud of ſprinkling is upon you. Then hold faſt, keep your birth right, and never ſell it for a meſs of Pottage; for ye are come unto Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the Blood of Sprinkling: That ſpeaketh better things, than the bloud of <hi>Abel.</hi> And thus now I have done with the fourth Argument, and with this Text.</p>

               <p n="1">I. As for the firſt, What the work of Meditation is, what's the true Notion of it: 'Tis ſeveral wayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it's call'd, a <hi>Remembring</hi> of God, in the 63 <hi>Pſalm, When I remember thee upon my Bed,</hi> which is explained by that which follows, <hi>And medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on thee, in the night watches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some times it's called, a <hi>Thinking</hi> on God; ſo in <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 48.9. <hi>We have thought of thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, O God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſometimes it is called, a <hi>Muſing</hi> on God: and ſo in the 143 <hi>Pſalm, I remember the dayes of old, I meditate on all thy works, I muſe on the work of thy hands.</hi> Thus it is ſeverally expreſt in Scripture</p>
               <pb n="514" facs="tcp:171186:90"/>
               <p>Great Authors, do deſcribe it ſeveral wayes.</p>
               <p>It is a vehement application of the ſoul, unto a thing, for the Inveſtigation and Experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof. So <hi>Gerſon,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>It is a ſtudious action of the mind, whereby a man labours to find out ſome hidden truth; ſo <hi>Auſtine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the exerciſe of a mans ſoul, whereby calling to Remembrance what he doth know already; he doth further think on't, and debate on't within himſelf, for his own profit and benefit; ſo Mr. <hi>Greenham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But plainly and briefly thus:</p>
               <p>It is the vehement, or intenſe application of the ſoul, unto ſome thing, whereby a mans mind doth ponder, dwell, and fix upon it, for his own profit and benefit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> There muſt be the application of the ſoul, to ſome thing; and therefore ſometimes it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by laying of a thing to heart: <hi>The Righteous are taken away, and no man layes it to heart;</hi> no man conſiders on't: <hi>If ye will not lay theſe things to heart,</hi> Mal. 2.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as there muſt be an Application, ſo there muſt be a vehement and intenſe Application of the ſoul, unto a thing. For every Conſideration don't make Meditation: <hi>Conſideration heightned, makes Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Meditation is the work of the whole ſoul: The Mind acts, and the Memory acts, and the Affections act; <hi>Let the Words of my mouth, and the Meditations of my heart:</hi> It is an intenſe and a vehement applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoul unto truth.</p>
               <p>But <hi>thirdly,</hi> There muſt be alſo a Fixation of the ſoul upon the thing: It is not every ſlight and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient thought, that makes Meditation; <hi>My medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be of thee, all the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y,</hi> Pſal. 119. 'Tis, <hi>Actio
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:171186:90"/> cunctabunda,</hi> ſaith <hi>Alvares.</hi> A man may think on God <hi>every</hi> day, and meditate on God <hi>no</hi> day: There muſt be a fixation of the ſoul upon ſome truth; a dwelling and fixing of the ſoul, upon ſome thing.</p>
               <p>But then, This muſt be in reference to ones own profit and benefit. Though I do think, and think much of ſin, if I do not think thereof to leave it, it is not Meditation.— Though I think on the life and the death of Chriſt, if it be not to conform un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, theſe thoughts will not amount to Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.— Though I think on the love and goodneſs of God, yet if it be not to get my heart inflam'd with love thereby, it will not amount to Meditation.</p>
               <p>Plainly then, Meditation for the true Nature, and the Notion of't, is a vehement, an intenſe applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoul, unto a thing; whereby a mans mind doth dwell, and inſiſt, and abide upon it, for his profit, and benefit: that's the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then <hi>Secondly,</hi> How and in what reſpects may a man be ſaid to meditate on God?</p>
               <p>Why look when a man doth meditate on the Name, Nature, Titles, and Attributes of God, then he is ſaid to meditate on God.</p>
               <p>On the Nature of God: ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. When I remember <hi>Thee</hi> upon my Bed, and meditate on <hi>Thee</hi> in the night watches.</p>
               <p>And look when a man doth meditate on Chriſt the Son of God, then he is ſaid for to meditate on God: For Chriſt is God: and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>Conſider the high Prieſt of your Profeſſion, looking unto Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And look when a man doth meditate on the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the Law and Statutes of God, then he is ſaid to meditate on God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. He delighteth in the Law of the Lord, and therein doth he meditate.</p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:171186:91"/>
               <p>And look when a man doth meditate on the works and Concernments of God, then in Scripture-phraſe he is ſaid to Meditate on God; And ſo in the 77. <hi>Pſal. I will Remember the works of the Lord; I will Remember thy wonderes, and I will meditate</hi> alſo <hi>of</hi> all <hi>thy works:</hi> So that briefly; Then a man is ſaid to meditate on God; Not onely when he doth me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on the nature of God; but when he doth me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on the Son of God, meditates on the Word of God, meditates on the Works and Concernments of God. And that's the ſecond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But how may it appear that it is a ſweet thing to meditate on God? That meditation-work is ſweet work, and that it is a ſweet thing to a gracious ſoul to meditate on God?</p>
               <p>Something firſt in the General, and then more particularly in reference to a gracious ſoul. In Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral:</p>
               <p>It is a ſweet to meditate on God. Will you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Nature, Name, and Attributes of God?</p>
               <p>Firſt is it not a ſweet thing to Injoy God? Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God is the life of our lives. And how do we Injoy God? God doth come down to us, and we do Aſcend and go up to him: Some-times God doth come down into our ſouls? Some-times there is an aſcent of the ſoul unto God. And what is the Ladder whereby we aſcend unto God, and <hi>take our turnes in Heaven with God,</hi> but believing Meditation?</p>
               <p>The more perfect any thing is, the more ſweet it is to lay out ones thought there on. Now God is all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; <hi>There is nothing not perfect in God:</hi> If you have a noſe-gay made up of flowers, and but one weed, the ſweetneſs of the noſe-gay is ſpoyl'd; <hi>There are perfections in God, and no weeds among them.</hi> If
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:171186:91"/> there be a Muſical Inſtrument and one ſtring out of order, all jarr's. There is no ſtring out of order among Gods perfections: perfection and nothing not perfect in God. You account it a ſweet thing to ſee your Lands, and your eſtate lie together, a ſweet thing to ſee all your Children together: Do but <hi>look and meditate on God, and you ſee all your wealth lie together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if the Names, Titles, Attributes of God be your relief in all Conditions; Then it muſt needs be a ſweet thing to meditate on God in this reſpect. Why now; <hi>The name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower, the righteous fly thereunto and are ſafe.</hi> A ſweet thing it is therefore to meditate on God in this reſpect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Will you Inſtance in the meditating on Chriſt the Son of God? You know what is ſaid by the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles. I ſate down under his ſhaddow:</hi> Sate down, how? 'Tis meditation ſets the ſoul down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhaddow of Chriſt— And then <hi>his fruit,</hi> whether Juſtification be the fruit, or ſanctification, or Conſolation; Then <hi>his fruit was</hi> ſweet unto my taſt.</p>
               <p>And If Jeſus Chriſt be our ſtanding relief againſt all Temptations, and Deſertions; Then it muſt needs be a ſweet thing to meditate and think much on him. Now he is our <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> our ſtanding relief againſt all our Temptation, and our Deſertions.</p>
               <p>But 3ly. will you Inſtance in meditating on the <hi>Word of God?</hi> 'Tis a ſweet thing to behold the light; and the <hi>word</hi> is a light, and Lanthorn unto our feet. Is it not a ſweet thing to taſte honey? <hi>David</hi> ſaith The word of the Lord was as hony and the hony-Comb. And the more 'tis meditated on, the more fully taſted.</p>
               <p>And if the Conſideration, and the meditation of the word of God be our great relief againſt all the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:171186:92"/> ſcorns and reproaches, and oppoſitions of the World, then certainly 'tis a ſweet thing to meditate on the word of God. Now do but look into the 119th <hi>Pſal.</hi> and you ſhall find <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking thus; <hi>Remove from me reproach and contempt; Princes did ſit and ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me</hi>—what relief had he?—<hi>But thy ſervant did meditate in thy Statutes.</hi> Here's his relief, <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> Great-men; They ſate and ſpake againſt me, and they reproach'd me, and they oppoſed me, but here was my relief, I did meditate in thy word.</p>
               <p>But Fourthly, will you Inſtance in the works of the Lord? There are Three ſorts of Gods works.</p>
               <p>There's the work of Creation.</p>
               <p>And the work of Providence.</p>
               <p>And the work of Redemption.</p>
               <p>As for the work of Creation: If it be a ſweet thing to behold and to conſider the workmanſhip of the Finger of human wiſdome: What a pleaſure and ſweetneſs is it to behold the workmanſhip of the Finger of Infinite wiſdome?</p>
               <p>And as for the works of Providence: If the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and the Conſideration of the Providence of God be our great help againſt the pain of unbelieving thoughts; Then it muſt needs be a ſweet thing to meditate on God in this reſpect.

               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:171186:92"/>
               <p>And as for the work of Redemption, There all the Attributes of God do meet: There is Wiſdom, there is Power, there is Mercy, there is Righteouſneſs, there is Faithfulneſs: And, <hi>If it be a ſweet thing to behold the Beams of the Sun, what a ſweet thing is it to behold all the Beams of Gods glorious Attributes, meeting in one work;</hi> which work the very Angels deſire to look into, where the Glory of God is: Certainly, It is a ſweet thing then to meditate on God, in regard of his works; Theſe things more generally.</p>
               <p>But now more particularly, as to our caſe.</p>
               <p>How may it appear, that it is a ſweet thing for a gracious ſoul, to meditate on God: It will appear to you by divers Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a ſweet thing for a good and gracious man, to meditate on God, and the things of God, becauſe it is natural to him. Natural works are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant works: It is a tedious and an irkſome thing to row againſt the ſtream of Nature; but Natural works are pleaſing works. Now as it is a natural thing for a worldly man, to think and meditate on the world, and the things thereof; ſo it is natural to a gracious man, to think and meditate on God, and the things of God. I pray, What is the reaſon, that wicked men take ſo much delight in thinking, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and muſing, on their ſins and ſinful wayes, but becauſe ſin is natural unto them: Why, a good man being made partaker of a Divine nature, 'tis natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to him therefore to think on God, and the wayes and things of God; and therefore pleaſant, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſweet.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, As it is natural to a gracious man to think on God, and the things of God, ſo 'tis ſutable to him. As 'tis a natural work, ſo 'tis a ſutable work: ſutable things are pleaſant; the more ſutable any
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:171186:93"/> thing is unto us, the more it pleaſeth us, all pleaſure and delights, ariſes from the conjunction of ſutables: If you have never ſo great an eſtate, if it be not ſuited to your heart, you have no delight in it. If you have never ſo ſmall an eſtate, if it be ſuitable to your heart, you are delighted and pleaſed in it. Now, what in all the world, ſo ſuitable to a gracious ſoul as God? Is the Object of a man's underſtanding <hi>Truth?</hi> God is truth. Is the Object of his Will <hi>Good?</hi> God is good. Is the object of his Affections <hi>Love?</hi> God is love. Is the ſoul of a man Immortal, Immaterial? God is ſo, an Immortal, and an Immaterial Beeing. Is the Soul of a man Eternal, <hi>a parte poſt?</hi> God is ſo, God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and unchangeable. Are our deſires infinite? God is Infinite. What is there that the ſoul of man can want, but it's anſwered in God? A ſutable good he is ſurely, therefore it muſt needs be a ſweet thing to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on God, and the things of God.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, and Eſpecially, As it is a ſuitable thing for a gracious ſoul to meditate on God, ſo 'tis profitable. Gain is ſweet: Now it is a very gainful thing, and very profitable for to meditate on God, and the things of God: Meditation work, is gainful work.</p>
               <p>For firſt of all, Meditation is a great help to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg: The more you think, and meditate on what you read and hear; the more you know, and though you read never ſo much, and hear never ſo much, if you don't meditate on what you read, or hear, it will amount to little, you will be never the wiſer: If a man doth meditate, he proves the wiſer. Mark what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>I am wiſer then mine Enemies,</hi> v. 89. <hi>I am wiſer then my Teachers, I am wiſer then the Antients,</hi> v. 98. <hi>Through thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thou haſt made me wiſer then mine enemies.</hi>—
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:171186:93"/> It may be ſo, they might be fools.— But ſaith he, <hi>I have more underſtanding, then all my Teachers,</hi> v. 99. I, but this Teacher may be ſome young man, newly come from the Univerſity.—I have more underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then all my Teachers: I but, ſaith he, <hi>I und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Through thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thou haſt made me wiſer than my enemies; for they are ever with me. I have more underſtanding than all my Teachers, for thy Teſtimonies are my Meditation. Meditatio ſapientiae Parens, Meditation is the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If I read, and read, and find ſuch and ſuch Not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons in a Book, if I be not Maſter of thoſe Notions, I am little the better for my reading. <hi>'Tis Meditation that makes you the Maſter of the Notions that you read,</hi> or that you hear, otherwiſe, it is but the Book's Notion ſtill. By meditation after a Sermon, a man may look further into a truth, than the Preacher ever intended: <hi>Meditation is a great help to Knowledge:</hi> that's the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As Meditation is a great help to Knowledge, ſo it is a great friend to Memory. <hi>Meditatio firmat memoriam:</hi> Meditation ſtrengthens Memory, it faſtens the things that we hear or read, in the memory. Many complain they have bad memories: Oh! their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are very bad, they cannot remember: what's the reaſon that we remember no more what we read, and what we hear, but becauſe we meditate no more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what we have heard, or read: Meditation is a great help to Memory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As Meditation is a great help to memory, ſo it
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:171186:94"/> is <hi>an Heart-warming work, a Friend to warmth of heart.</hi> If a thing be cold, you chafe it, if a mans body be cold, you chafe it, and rub it; and by chafing and rubbing of a cold part, you put life and warmth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: <hi>Meditation chafes the ſoul,</hi> and rubs the ſoul with a truth. And what's the reaſon that our hearts are no warmer by what we read, or hear, or obſerve, but becauſe we meditate no more on't. Meditation is a heart-warming work.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As it is an heart-warming work, ſo it is that which will keep your hearts, and ſouls, from ſinful thoughts. When the Veſſel is full, you can put in no more: If the Veſſel be full of puddle water, you can't put in Wine; if the Veſſel be full of wine, you cannot put in puddle water. If the heart be full of ſinful thoughts, there is no room for holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly thoughts; if the heart be fill'd with holy and heavenly thoughts by Meditation, there is no room for evil and ſinful thoughts. And what's the reaſon that mens hearts are ſo full of ſinful and evil thoughts, but becauſe their hearts are no more full of God; they think no more, they meditate no more of God: Thereby (I ſay) you will be kept from ſinful thoughts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As it will keep you from ſinful thoughts; ſo it will fit and tune your hearts for every Duty: For Prayer, for Thanksgiving, for holy Conference and Communication of good things to others.</p>
               <p>For Prayer, 'tis <hi>Orationis Mater,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As it is the Siſter of Reading; ſo it is the Mother of Prayer. Though a mans heart be much indiſpoſed to prayer, yet, if he can but fall into a meditation of <hi>God,</hi> and the things of <hi>God,</hi> his heart will ſoon come off to Prayer. <hi>Meditation lies ſo near unto Prayer,</hi> that in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the word that ſignifies to Pray, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:171186:94"/> to Meditate: And therefore you ſhall obſerve, that whereas in ſome Books 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Iſaac went out to Pray,</hi> in other Books 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Iſaac went out to Meditate. Meditation is a friend to Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is a Friend to Thanksgiving; and therefore ſaith the Pſalmiſt here in the Text, <hi>I will ſing praiſe unto my God, my meditation of him ſhall be ſweet;</hi> they go together.</p>
               <p>And it is a great help unto holy Conference, (which I am afraid is too much wanting among us) Private meditation on <hi>God</hi> and the things of <hi>God,</hi> is a great help unto holy Conference. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.1. <hi>My heart is inditing a good matter</hi> — What then? <hi>I ſpeak of the things which I have made touching the King: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.</hi> — When? — When the heart hath been at work in Meditation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.12. <hi>I will meditate alſo of all thy works.</hi>— What then? — <hi>and talk of thy doings.</hi> See how Conference comes in. <hi>I will meditate alſo of all thy works, and talk of all thy doings.</hi> So that thus then, Meditation will fit and prepare you, and tune your hearts to Prayer, Thanksgiving, holy Conference, and other Duties.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As Meditation is a great friend to Prayer, and to other Duties; ſo it is a help unto growth in grace, and the Knowledge of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>A help to grow: The more we meditate on what we read and hear, the more we grow. And what's the reaſon, that men grow no more after all that they have heard and read, but becauſe they meditate no more. <hi>The beſt Scholar Reads and Meditates, and Meditates and Reads.</hi> And the beſt Chriſtian reads and meditates, and hears and meditates. The grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian doth. Suppoſe now you have a load of Dung, or Marl, to lay upon the ground, you lay it
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:171186:95"/> upon the ground, to make it fat and fruitful; but if it be laid upon the ground and not ſpread, will it make the graſs or the corn grow; no, it will hinder the growth of the graſs: The ſpreading of it makes the graſs grow: So now, come and lay down a load of Truth upon a poor Soul, and let it lye unſpread, it rather hinders his growth; but the Hand of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation ſpreads it. And, I ſay, What is the reaſon that s men grow no more, but becauſe it may be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or Truths, like loads, are laid down upon the Soul, but no ſpreading by the Hand of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As Meditation-work is a great friend to growth in grace; ſo thereby alſo your hearts ſhall be kept ſavoury and ſpiritual in the midſt of all your outward and worldly Imployments. Oh, ſaith one, that my heart were but more ſavory and ſpiritual in all my outward Imployments, and in my Calling. Why, <hi>Meditation carries a Still up and down in the ſoul,</hi> whereby it doth <hi>extract</hi> and <hi>diſtill</hi> the Virtue and the Juice of all the leaves of Providence, that it meets with in the Calling. You ſee how it is with a Cow, or with a Sheep, though the graſs that the Cow or the Sheep eats be green; yet by Concoction, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting of it, it turns white, and turns into milk: ſo now, though that which you read, that which you meet withal in your callings be but ordinarily as the common graſs, yet if you can digeſt it, it will be milk unto you. And how are theſe things digeſted, but by Meditation?</p>
               <p>Friends, Thereby you ſteal out of your calling to get unto God.</p>
               <p>Thereby your hearts are <hi>perfum'd</hi> as you walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in your calling and in your place.</p>
               <p>This is that, that will keep your hearts ſavoury
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:171186:95"/> and ſpiritual in all your outward and worldly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: that's a ſeventh thing.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Thereby alſo you ſhall fill up all the chinks and crevices of your lives and ſpend your ſpare times for God. There is no man but hath his ſpare times, more or leſs: Some more, ſome leſſe, but all have their ſpare times: That look as it is with a Book, all Books have their margents, ſome Books have a greater margent, ſome a leſſer, and a narrower margent, but all Books have their margents; <hi>ſo all men have their margents, their ſpare times:</hi> ſome have a greater margent, and more time to ſpare than others, ſome have a leſſer and a narrower margent, and leſſe ſpare-time than others. But all men have their margents, and their ſpare times. Some men know not what to do with their ſpare time, therefore they call in for Dice, and call in for Cards, and call in for Vanity. Some, when they are out of Imployment, they dare not be alone. Have but the skill of Meditation, to meditate on God and the things of God, and you will never be afraid to be alone: your margents will be all filled up, <hi>all the chincks and crevices of your lives ſhall be all filled up with God:</hi> Therefore, O what a profitable thing is this work of Meditation!</p>

               <p n="4">4. Again, As the work of Meditation is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, natural, ſuitable; ſo it is very contentful, and ſatisfying to a gracious Soul. What perſon in Love, is not ſatisfied in thinking, and meditating on the perſon loved? What gracious loving Child, is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in thinking on his Father, that's abſent in an other Country? So what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, in the 63d. <hi>Pſalm, My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied, as with marrow and fatneſs</hi>— When?—<hi>When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.</hi> I ſhall not only be <hi>contented,</hi> but my Soul ſhall be <hi>ſatisfied</hi>— how?— In a way of Meditation: 'Tis Meditation-work that is ſoul-ſatisfying work.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And as it is ſoul-ſatisfying work, ſo this work of Meditation to a gracious ſoul, is a moſt delightful work: What greater delight, than to think on that <hi>God</hi> in whom he doth moſt delight? Is it delightful to a wicked man to ſit and muſe, and meditate on his ſinful wayes; and will it not be delightful to a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:171186:97"/> ſoul, to ſit and think, and muſe, and meditate on the Lord? Certainly, it is a work that is moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to a gracious ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But how can it be ſo delightful? 'tis a hard work, Meditation work is hard work, and therefore how can it be ſo delightful to a gracious ſoul?</p>
               <p>Yes, very well, for though it be hard in regard of its practice, yet it may be ſweet and delightful in regard of its profit. Is it not a hard work to the Husbandman to plow, to ſow, to reap; and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful in regard of its profit? Is it not a hard wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Is it not a hard work for a man to make ſuch ventures at Sea, through all ſtorms; and yet it is delightful in regard of its profit; the profit of the Voiage makes it delightful: Why, you have heard now the profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of the work of Meditation—It is an help to Knowledge, thereby your knowledge is raiſed— Thereby your Memory is ſtrengthened — Thereby your Hearts are warmed — Thereby you will be freed from ſinful thoughts — Thereby your hearts will be tuned to every duty — Thereby you will grow in grace — Thereby you will fill up all the chinks and crevices of your lives — And know how to ſpend your ſpare time, and imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But, Secondly, Hard work you ſay, and therefore how can it be delightful!</p>
               <p>Friends, The harder the work is, the ſweeter it is, being overcome: 'Tis a ſweet thing to overcome:
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:171186:98"/>
'Tis hard thing to fight, but 'tis a ſweet thing to overcome: <hi>The harder the Nutt is to crack, the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is the meat when it is crackt;</hi> the harder the Scripture is that is to be opened, the ſweeter is the kernel, the truth when it is opened. When God opened the Rock, the Waters that flowed out were as ſweet as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Now meditation makes a Conqueſt of the work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though it be a hard thing to meditate on God and the things of God, yet notwithſtanding do but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k is hard, and you will ſay that the difficulty of the work is no Impeachment to the ſuavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the ſweetneſs thereof. There are two things that make meditation hard:</p>
               <p>The one is, becauſe men are not uſed thereunto, men are not exerciſed therein:</p>
               <p>And another is, becauſe they don't love God enough:</p>
               <p>Every thing is hard at the firſt: Writing is hard at the Firſt, Painting hard at the firſt, and the getting Languages hard at the firſt. A Trade is hard at the Firſt. So certainly the work of meditation will be hard at the firſt: <hi>There is nothing not hard to thoſe that are unwilling,</hi> There is nothing hard to thoſe that Love. <hi>Love makes all things eaſie:</hi> Is it an hard thing for a Lover to think or meditate on the Perſon lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Is it a hard thing for a Child at a diſtance from his Father to think or meditate on his Father, and his Father's love and kindneſs, is this hard? Indeed to a Rebellious Child 'tis hard, to a Child that's run away from his Father 'tis hard; but for a loving and an obedient Child, it is not hard. And what's the reaſon that the work of meditation is ſo hard to many of us, but becauſe in truth we are not uſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto—or becauſe we are rebellious Children, and don't love the Lord as we ought to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, May not a wicked man me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on God, and find ſweetneſs in the Work?</p>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:171186:98"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, that 'tis poſſible that a wicked man may ſeparate, and ſequeſter himſelf unto this work of reading, ſtudying, and thinking on the word and Law of God: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.7. <hi>Now a certaine man of the ſervants of Saul was there that day, detey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before the Lord, and his Name was Doeg.</hi> He was there, ſeparated, cloyſtered for the ſtudying of the Law, and yet a <hi>Doeg,</hi> a great perſecuter. And who doth not ſee it? Fryers, and Monks ſeparate and Cloyſter up themſelves at this very day, and ſpend much time in that which they call Meditation.</p>
               <p>Yea poſſible it is, that a wicked man may not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think and meditate on the Law of God, but he may find ſome ſweetneſs therein; for if wicked men do delight in their approach unto God, as in the 58. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Why may they not delight alſo and find a ſweetneſs in their meditation concerning God.</p>
               <p>But 3dly. Though a wicked man may meditate on God, and the things of God, and find ſome ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the work of meditation, yet with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. There is a great deal of difference between the ſweetneſs that a wicked man finds in the work of meditation, and the ſweetneſs that a good man finds in the work of meditation. For though a wicked man may meditate, and find ſome ſweetneſs in the work; yet not withſtanding the ſweetneſs doth rather ariſe from the ſatisfaction of his natural Conſcience, than from the Connaturalneſs and ſuitableneſs that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his heart and the work. Poſſibly a <hi>Doeg,</hi> a wicked man may be Convinced that he ought to read the ſcriptures, and to meditate the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ein, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving don ſo his Conſcience is ſatisfied, and he finds ſweetneſs therein; But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>his ſweetneſs doth rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the ſatisfying of his n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tural Conſcience, than from any Connaturalneſſe and ſuitableneſſe
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:171186:99"/> that there is between his heart and the work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is one thing for a man to find a ſweetneſs in this work of meditation in reference to his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, Calling, or livelyhood; another thing for to find a ſweetneſs in it in reference unto God, to his own practice, and holineſs of life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Suppoſe I be a Preacher: 'Tis my duty to ſtudy the Scriptures: And ſtudying of the Scripture I meditate, and when things come off well, I have a ſweetneſs therein; Yet all this may be in reference to my calling, to my imployment, and to my lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. But now a gracious man he meditates on God and the things of God in reference to God, to his holineſs, and practice; Mark what <hi>David</hi> ſaith. 119th <hi>Pſal. I will delight my ſelf in thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which I have loved. My hands alſo will I lift up unto thy Commandments, which</hi> I <hi>have loved; and I will meditate in thy ſtatutes.</hi> Lord, ſaith he, I <hi>love</hi> thy Commandements: And upon that account I <hi>meditate</hi> in thy Commandements: And I don't onely medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, but <hi>my hands alſo will I lift up unto thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> For practice, I will not onely lay my eie to reading, I will not onely lay my head to ſtudying, but my <hi>hands</hi> alſo will I lift up unto thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to take hold on them, and to practiſe them. So that thus a gracious ſoul, as he meditates on God and the things of God, and he finds a ſweetneſs; ſo 'tis in reference unto God, and to his own practice and holineſs in Converſation.</p>
               <p>But 3dly. Though a wicked man may meditate on God and the things of <hi>God,</hi> and find a ſweetneſs in ſo doing; yet he doth alſo find as great, if not a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſweetneſs in other things, and in meditating and muſing upon his Sins, and in the World, <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>b.</hi> 20.12. <hi>Though wickedneſs be ſweet in his mouth, though he
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:171186:99"/> hide it under his tongue, though he ſpare it, and forſake it not, but keep it ſtill within his mouth,</hi> as a ſweet pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; here is his great delight. Though he may me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on <hi>God,</hi> and the things of <hi>God,</hi> and find ſome ſweetneſs there, his great delight is here, in his ſin; And he finds rather more delight and pleaſure in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on his ſin, and ſinfull courſe, and meditating on the World and the things thereof, than he findes in meditating on <hi>God</hi> and the things of <hi>God.</hi> But now a Gracious man delights in the Law of the Lord, and therein doth he meditate: why, but doth he not alſo ſtand in the <hi>Counſel of the ungodly?</hi>—No, <hi>he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in the Counſel of the ungodly, but his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w doth he meditate:</hi> —he ſtandeth not in the way of ſinners: Poſſibly he may meet with ſinners, and wicked men occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; but he doth not <hi>walk</hi> with them ordinarily, he doth not <hi>ſtand</hi> with them, but his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and therein doth he meditate.</p>
               <p>But to ſay no more. Take a wicked man, and though he may meditate on <hi>God,</hi> and the things of <hi>God,</hi> and find ſome ſweetneſs therein, he doth not do this ordinarily, meditate ordinarily, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, <hi>God is not in all his thoughts, God</hi> may be in ſome of his thoughts, but <hi>God</hi> is not in all his thoughts. But this meditation of <hi>God</hi> and the things of <hi>God, is the ordinary work of a good man,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in the Law of the Lord, and therein doth he meditate day and night. Meditation on <hi>God</hi> and the things of <hi>God</hi> is his ordinary work; So that thus now you ſee the difference, and thus you ſee the Doctrine cleared: 'Tis a ſweet thing to a gracious ſoul to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on <hi>God</hi> and the things of <hi>God,</hi> meditation-work is ſweet work to a gratious ſoul.—Sweet for it is Naturall,—Sweet, for it is ſuitable—Sweet,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:171186:100"/> for it is profitable.—Sweet, for it is ſatisfying —Sweet, for it is delightful: And, If theſe things be ſo;</p>
               <p>What ſhall we ſay of thoſe that never ſpent any time yet alone in meditating on <hi>God,</hi> and the things of <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Why, in the time of the Old Teſtament the beaſts were unclean that did not chew the Cudd; in the New Teſtament it's made the property of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Ground, that the ſeed falls upon it, and it is not covered over with meditation, and conſideration.</p>
               <p>What, Is it the property of a gratious ſoul to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on <hi>God,</hi> and doth he find ſo much ſweetneſs in meditating on <hi>God</hi> and the things of <hi>God?</hi> and have I liv'd Twenty years, have I liv'd Thirty years, have I liv'd Fourty years, and never ſpent an hower yet in private in meditation on <hi>God</hi> and the things of <hi>God,</hi> how can I think I am Godly?</p>
               <p>If this Doctrine be true, that a gracious holy man finds a ſweetneſs in meditating on <hi>God,</hi> and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion work is ſweet work to a gracious ſoul, then, Friends, why ſhould you not all labour to be found here, in this work of meditation. I fear we are ſtrangers hereunto: many come and hear Sermons, and write Sermons one time after another, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>they ſtand up upon duſty ſhelves, and are never meditated on:</hi> But is this true that a gracious man finds ſo much ſweetneſs in the work of meditation, and that it is ſo profitable a work? why ſhould we not all labour to be found herein?</p>
               <p>You will ſay then unto me, Meditation is a ſweet work we confeſs, and very profitable; but what ſhould I do that I may be able to cary on this work of
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:171186:100"/> meditation with ſweetneſs? I have found it hard ſome times, and after I have begun it I threw it off. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have thought that the work of meditation is Incumbent onely upon <hi>Preachers,</hi> but I ſee it is ſweet, and profitable and good for every one. What ſhall I do then that I may be able to carry on this work of meditation with ſweetneſs?</p>
               <p>That I ſhall ſpeak to, more largely: Only for the preſent give me leave to ſay ſome thing to it by way of premiſes; I'le onely ſpeak to Four Caſes, and ſo conclude this Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Would you meditate on <hi>God</hi> and the things of <hi>God</hi> with ſweetneſs? Firſt, In caſe that you would medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on the Nature, and Attributes of <hi>God,</hi> be ſure that you divide your thoughts, for variety is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing: All the Attributes of God are worthy of our thoughts; do not therefore <hi>ſtand poring</hi> on one excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or upon one Attribute; but when you are moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>put your thoughts upon that in God which is moſt cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:</hi> When you are moſt cheerful, put your thoughts upon that in <hi>God,</hi> which is moſt dread-ful: ever more divide your thoughts, if you be to meditate on <hi>God,</hi> and the Name and Nature and Attributes of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Secondly, be ſure of this, That you meditate, not in a way of Reaſon only, when you come to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on <hi>God,</hi> but in a way of Faith. For, Who can give the Reaſon of the Trinity in Unity, and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Trinity?

                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:171186:101"/> the Nature, the Names, the Attributes of <hi>God,</hi> that then your meditation be carryed on <hi>in a way of Faith, and not of Reaſon only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And then be ſure of this, that you never think of <hi>God</hi> out of <hi>Chriſt: I thought upon God and was troubled,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, Why? he did not think of Chriſt too.

               <p>And never think on Chriſt out of the Goſpel: For as you may not think on God out of Chriſt, ſo you may not meditate on Chriſt out of the Goſpel: Chriſt is a living Goſpel, and the Goſpel a dead Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And in all your meditations on Chriſt, be ſure that you obſerve, what that Title of Chriſt is, that is moſt ſuitable to your condition, and then meditate thereupon.</p>

Thus then, <hi>Look upon the Word as your Fathers Letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And look upon the Scripture alſo as your own Evidence: A man hath an Evidence for Land, and, it may be, the parchment is a duſty thing, yet he takes a great deal of pains in reading it over, and thinking on't; Why, (ſaith one that ſtands by) Why will you ſpend ſo much time in reading of a duſty Parchment? But, O Friend, ſaith he, Friend, it's my Evidence for my Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. So now, when men come to the Word, and do not look upon it as their Evidence for their Land, they have no liſt to meditate on it, but when a man comes to the Word, and can look upon it as his Evidence for a great Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then he loves to meditate on it. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber therefore theſe two things, — That all that is in the Word, is either <hi>Commandment,</hi> or <hi>Promiſe, — Threatning,</hi> or <hi>Example:</hi> — And look upon the Word as your Fathers Letters and as your own Evidence. And then,</p>

               <p>Thirdly, If you would meditate on God, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Works, be ſure of this, that you never go to <hi>read Gods Work, but by Gods Candle:</hi> The Work of God is a great Book; but the work of God cannot be read but by Gods word: <hi>God hath a Candle of his own to read his W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Be ſure you look upon every work of <hi>God,</hi> as coming out of the hand of your <hi>Father,</hi> that you may ſay, O this is my <hi>Fathers</hi> work, and this is my <hi>Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus I have given you ſome taſte: But how this work of Meditation is to be carried on with ſweetneſs, I reſerve for the next Exerciſe; only for the preſent, you have heard what a profitable thing it is, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on the things of <hi>God:</hi> What now remains, but to get up and be thinking and meditating on <hi>God,</hi> and the things of <hi>God.</hi>

               <p>I am a ſtranger to this work of Meditation; I have often read the Scriptures, and not meditated on them. I have often heard the Word, and not meditated thereon: I have ſometimes begun to meditate, but finding it a hard work, I have left it off again. And ſometimes I have thought that this work is incumbent onely upon Students, and Preachers: But if it be our duty to meditate on God, and the things of God, what ſhall we do that the work of holy Meditation, may be carried on with profit, and with ſweetneſs?</p>

               <p>And then draw forth ſome Arguments, or Motives to preſs you all hereunto.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is our work and duty, to meditate on God, and the things of God: Will you inſtance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Explication at the firſt.</p>
               <p>Will you inſtance in the Nature, Titles, and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God? Why, it is our work and duty ſo to meditate on God: For wicked men are blamed, that <hi>God is not in all their thoughts;</hi> If they be blamed for this, that God is not in all their thoughts, then ſurely God is to be in all our thoughts.</p>
               <p>Good and holy men are commended, and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this: <hi>They that feared the Lord, ſpake often one to another, and a book of Remembrance was written for them that feared the Lord, and that Thought on his Name.</hi> They are commended,— and they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.

               <p>And who doth not know that it is our duty to praiſe the Lord: not onely to be thankful to God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of benefits received, but to pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.— How doth he tune his heart to this praiſe? <hi>We have th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ught of thy loving kindneſs, O God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The more that the heart of any man is laid in with meditation, the more pregnant will his words be in
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:171186:104"/> the praiſes of God. So that thus then, it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for to meditate upon this account.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> Will you inſtance in Chriſt the Son of God? As it is our work and duty to meditate on the Nature, Titles, and Attributes of God, ſo to ſpend and to lay out our thoughts upon Chriſt the Son of God. You may obſerve therefore, that this word <hi>Behold,</hi> is oftener prefixed, and ſet before the Myſtery of Chriſt, than before any other Depth, or Myſtery in Scripture.— And why ſo? But to ſhew that this Depth, and this Myſtery, is that eſpecially that calls forth our Conſideration, and our Meditation. There are four things concerning Chriſt, which do call for our meditation.</p>
               <p>The Perſonal excellency of Chriſt.—</p>
               <p>The Offices of Chriſt.— The Life, and —The Death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As for the Perſonal excellencies of Chriſt, you read what the Apoſtle ſaith, in the 7. c. of the <hi>Heb. v.</hi> 4. <hi>Now conſider how great this man was, Mechiſedec,</hi> the Type of Chriſt: And if the Type were ſo great, Chriſt is greater.— And if we are to <hi>conſider</hi> the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the Type, much more to conſider and meditate on the Greatneſs, and Perſonal excellencies of Chriſt typified.</p>
               <p>And as for the Offices of Chriſt, you read what the Apoſtle ſaith, in the 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v. Wherefore, holy Brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, conſider the Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our Profeſſion, Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the Life of Chriſt; you know what the Apoſtle ſaith, in the 12. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v. Looking unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the Author and Finiſher of our Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the Sufferings of Chriſt, you read what follows; <hi>Who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame; for conſider him</hi> (v. 3.)
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:171186:104"/> 
                  <hi>that endured ſuch contradiction of ſinners againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. So that thus then, we are to meditate on God upon this account; laying out, and ſpending our thoughts and meditations upon Chriſt the Son of God.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Will you inſtance in the Word of God? Why, as we are to meditate on Chriſt, the Son of God, ſo we are to meditate on the Word of God: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.15. <hi>I will meditate on thy Precepts,</hi> v. 23. <hi>Thy Servant did meditate on thy Statutes,</hi> v. 48. <hi>And I will meditate on thy Statutes,</hi> at the 93. <hi>v. O how I love thy Law, it is my meditation all the day.</hi> The Word of God we are to meditate on; to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on God, and the things of God upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Now here are four things, that will lead you out to meditation.</p>
               <p>The exactneſs of the Commandment.</p>
               <p>The faithfulneſs of the Promiſe.</p>
               <p>The terrour of the Threatning.</p>
               <p>And the weightineſs of the Examples, all which meet in the Scriptures, and in the Word of God. And accordingly we are to meditate on the Word of God, upon this account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Will you inſtance in the Works of God? VVhy, as we are to meditate on the Word, ſo we are alſo to meditate on the VVorks of God. The work of <hi>Creation,</hi> the work of <hi>Providence,</hi> and the work of <hi>Redemption.</hi> The works of God are <hi>ſought out</hi> of all thoſe that have pleaſure in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. <hi>I remember the dayes of old, I meditate on all thy Works, I muſe on the work of thy hands.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> did, and thus ſhould we alſo do; ſo that thus then you ſee, that it is our work, and our duty, to meditate on God, and the things of God, in reference to his Nature, Name, and Attributes.— In reference to his Son,— In reference to his VVord,— and
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:171186:105"/> in reference to the works of God. And that's the firſt General.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Now ſecondly, This work of Meditation, is every mans work.— It is every dayes work.— And it is that work that is conſiſtent with every buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and condition.</p>
               <p>Firſt, (I ſay) 'Tis every mans work; it is the work of the wicked;— and it is the work of the Godly.</p>
               <p>'Tis the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I conſidered my wayes, and turned my feet unto thy Teſtimonies,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> Conſider your wayes; or, as in the <hi>Hebrew, ſet your heart</hi> upon your wayes.— And when doth a man ſet his heart upon his wayes, but when he doth ſeriouſly ponder and meditate on his wayes? Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s work of Meditation therefore, I ſay, it is the work of the wicked: It is their firſt ſtep unto Coverſion.</p>
               <p>And 'tis the work of the godly; Meditation-work, is a godly mans work.— For either he is weak, or ſtrong;</p>
               <p>If he be weak, he hath need of it that he may be ſtrengthened.</p>
               <p>If he be ſtrong, he hath need of it that he may be quickned. There is no man but hath need of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>
               <p>If a man be a Beginner, he ought to meditate that he may proceed:</p>
               <p>If he be a Proficient, he ought to meditate that he may be perfect:</p>
               <p>If he be Perfect with Goſpel-perfection, he ought to meditate that he may hold on his perfection, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:171186:105"/> It's made the general deſcription of a good man, He delighteth in the Law of the Lord; and in that Law doth he meditate.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it is every mans work, ſo 'tis eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dayes work. There are ſome ſpecial times (as you will hear) which are more fit for meditation. But this work of meditation is every dayes work: <hi>When I awake,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I am ever with thee.</hi> How? By prayer and meditation: <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwayes before me.</hi>— How, but by meditation and prayer? What time is there that is not fit for this work of Meditation?</p>
               <p>Is the Sabbath day unfit for it? No: There is a Prayer for the Sabbath, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. to meditate on the works of God.</p>
               <p>Is the week-day unfit for this work of Meditation? No, the Sabbath day is our market day; and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have bought our ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> I am ſure that <hi>David,</hi> in the 119. <hi>Pſal.</hi> ſaith, that his meditation was at work, all the day long; <hi>It is my

He delighteth in the Law of the Lord, and therein doth he meditate <hi>Day and Night.</hi> So that that's the Second thing: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation work is every days work. As 'tis every mans work, ſo 'tis every dayes work. And,</p>
               <p n="3">3. As it is every dayes work, ſo it is that work that is conſiſtent with every buſineſs, and with every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. A Garment that will fit the back of every condition. What dunghil-condition, but this flower of Meditation may grow thereupon? In <hi>Judg.</hi> the 5th 'tis ſaid there, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>They that are delivered from the noiſe of Archers in the places of drawing water; There ſhall they rehearſe the righteous acts of the Lord.</hi>—There, where? why <hi>in the places of drawing Water;</hi> When they are in the field, drawing waer: And if that be a fit place be rehearſe the righteous acts of the Lord, certainly then it is a place fit for meditation: <hi>And if that the place of the Drawing Water, then the very place of ſcraping Trenchers, and ſweeping the kennel may be a place fit for meditation?</hi> If that the place of drawing Water, be a place fit for rehearſing the Acts of the Lord; what place, what condition, what buſineſs, but Meditation may accompany it?</p>
               <p>Poſſibly a man may be ſick, and he may be kept from Books, or he may be kept from hearing; but yet he may meditate on <hi>God,</hi> and the things of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Poſſibly he may be thrown into Priſon, and he may be kept from Books and Bible, yet he cannot be kept from Meditation. It's ſaid of Mr. <hi>Glover,</hi> that Great Martyr in Queen Maryes time, that lying in Priſon a <hi>Coventry,</hi> it was told him, he ſhould be remooved to a cloſe Priſon at <hi>Litchfield,</hi> and all Books taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him; At that he was much troubled, but ſaith
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:171186:106"/> he, I ſat down and conſidered, and meditated with my ſelf, Is <hi>God</hi> the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Coventry,</hi> and not of <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field?</hi> Is not <hi>God</hi> the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> as well as of <hi>Coventry:</hi> And when I had thought on this thing, and meditated thus, my heart was quiet within me. Surely there is no condition ſo ſower, but Sweet Meditation may grow thereon: Now if this work of Meditation be a work that is Conſiſtent with every buſineſs, and every condition—every dayes work, and every mans work, why ſhould we not be found in the practice of it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But you will ſay 3dly, What help, or what means to this work of Meditation? What ſhall I do, how and by what means ſhould this work of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be performed?</p>
               <p>Firſt, If you would Meditate on <hi>God</hi> rightly and duly (to ſpeak firſt by way of means, and then for the rules of direction afterwards) be very ſenſible of your want, and of your neglect herein. A man is never more fit for a duty, then when he is very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his neglect therein ſenſibleneſs of neglect of former duty, fitts one for future duty. If a man have very great poſſeſſions, and he loſe them, he is very ſenſible of the loſs thereof, why now look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the 17th <hi>Job,</hi> and you ſhall find there are <hi>Thought</hi>-poſſeſſions: ſaith he, <hi>My dayes are paſt, my purpoſes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.</hi> In the <hi>Heb.</hi> even the <hi>poſſeſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſeſſions,</hi> and of our Meditations, the more fit we ſhall be for this work of Meditation. Firſt therefore be very ſenſible of your want and neglect of this work of Meditation thus long.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would meditate indeed on God and the things of God, labour more and more for a Serious Spirit: A frothy, leight, and giggling diſpoſition, is never fit for Meditation: Labour therefore to be ſerious. And there are three or four things that will poiſe and make your hearts ſerious.</p>
               <p>The ſight of the glorious Majeſty of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſenſe of your Eternal Condition, Eternity, Eternity.</p>
               <p>Humiliation for Sin.</p>
               <p>And converſe with thoſe that are ſerious. Be ſerious, and you will be more fit for Meditation: That's the Second.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you would indeed meditate on God and the things of God, labour more and more for a Fixed Spirit: Fixation of Spirit is a great friend to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. An unſettled, an unfixed ſoul, cannot meditate: Fix therefore firſt. And there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things that may fix your Spirits.</p>
               <p>The great and weighty Judgments of God that are upon us, may help to fix us, and hang lead upon our heels.</p>
               <p>In caſe you are to come to Meditation, or any other Work, come free, and don't leave any buſineſſe ſtanding at the Door: for a hundred to one, but your hearts will ſtep out unto it, at the time of your Work, whether Meditation, or Prayer, or any thing elſe. Therefore come free unto every Duty, if you would be fixed.</p>
               <p>And labour for Intention of Affection. In Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:171186:107"/> Prayer, or any other Work, be Intenſe: We uſe to ſay, when the Candle burns, the Mouſe doth not nibble, but when the Candle is out, then the Mouſe nibbles: when our hearts are warm and lively in Prayer and Meditation, we are free from diſtractions; the Mouſe nibbles not.</p>
               <p>And in caſe you meet with any diſtraction in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or other duty, don't ſtand to Correct your heart in the time of the duty, but go on with your work. If a woman carries a Child abroad among friends, and the Child cries and makes a diſturbance, the mother don't then correct the Child there; but calls the Child to an account when ſhe comes at home: for ſaith ſhe, Elſe would my correction be a further diſturbance to the company: So here, when you meet with diſtractions in duty, if you call your hearts to an account then, it will be a further diſturbance; but on with your preſent duty, correct afterward; and thus ſhall your hearts be the more fixed, and fixation of heart is a great help to Meditation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you would indeed meditate on <hi>God</hi> and the things of <hi>God,</hi> be ſure that you lay out ſuch objects as may give entertainment to your thoughts. For if there be no Corn in the Quern, what grinding will there be? Have therefore objects laid out to exerciſe your thoughts withal, upon all occaſions; And ſo when you have any ſpare time, your Objects lying by, you will be preſently upon the work of Meditation: only let thoſe Objects be ſuch as are drawing, alluring, thought-begetting Objects, and Thought-entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Objects: But then</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you would meditate on God and the things of God, ſtrengthen your Love and Delight; for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation grows upon the ſtalk of Love and Delight: And the more a man doth love God and the things of
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:171186:108"/> God, the more he meditates thereon: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>O how I love thy Law?</hi>—what then—<hi>It is my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation all the day:</hi> this was much; his meditation all the day,—What's the reaſon? — Why, his Love was beyond expreſſion; <hi>O how</hi> I love thy Law! It is my meditation all the day. Love loves to be thinking on the perſon loved. It carries the Picture of the Perſon or thing loved up and down in its boſome; the more you love, the more you meditate; and the more you delight, the more you meditate. Can a Woman forget her Child? no, why? becauſe ſhe loves it. Can a Worldly man forget the World, his Money and his Houſe or Land, can he forget this? no, why? becauſe he loves them: What's the reaſon we meditate no more, but becauſe we love God no more? Do but ſtrengthen your love to God and the things of God, and your delight in God and the things of God, and you will meditate more. This is the fifth means unto the work of Meditation, <hi>Strengthen your love to, and your delight in the Lord:</hi> And then</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you would meditate on God and the things of God, Then labour to get a deep Impreſſion of the things of God upon your heart and ſoul. 'Tis deep impreſſions that calls for meditation. A man reads the word of God, and it may be underſtands it, but he don't meditate—Why? — becauſe the word made no impreſſion upon his heart as he went along. But if he read it, and underſtand it, and hath an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion made upon his ſoul as he reads it, then he thinks on't afterwards: As in hearing the Word of God, a man hears the Word of God in Publick or in Private, and he meditates not thereupon — Why? — Why, becauſe it has no impreſsion upon him. Poſsibly a man may think of the free grace of God, yet if it make no impreſsion upon his ſoul, he don't
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:171186:108"/> go away and meditate on it. If a man think on the Wrath of God, and it make an impreſsion upon him, he goes away, and is ſtill in the thoughts thereof: What's the reaſon, that many poor ſouls, troubled in Conſcience, are alwayes thinking of Hell, and Judgement, and Wrath, but becauſe the Wrath of God hath made a deep impreſsion upon their ſouls; and the more deep the impreſsion is upon your ſoul, the more full will your meditation be: You ſee how it was in former times, when they went in proceſsion, at the end of the Pariſh, they would take up a Boy and whip him,— Why? that he might remember the bounds of the Pariſh: for, Paſsion is the beſt Door-keeper of Memory. And as paſsion is the Door-keeper of Memory; ſo Impreſsion is the Door-keeper of Meditation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If you would meditate on God and the things of God, Take heed that your hearts and your hands, be not too full of the world, and the employments thereof. The more full your hand is of worldly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, the more you will think thereon, and the more you think thereon, the leſs you will think of <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d</hi> and the things of <hi>God.</hi> And what is the reaſon that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meditate and think ſo little of <hi>God</hi> and the things of <hi>God,</hi> but becauſe their hearts are ſo full of the World, <hi>Where their treaſure is, there will their hearts b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>O ſaith one, I would think on God, and I would meditate on <hi>God</hi> with all my heart, but meditation-work is a work of time, it will coſt time, and I have no time; my hands are ſo full of buſineſs, and ſo full of imployment, I have no time for this work; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is not a tranſient Thought, but it is a work of time, and will ask time, and I have no time. Mark therefore what <hi>David</hi> ſaith in the 119. Pſalm. <hi>Lord incline my heart unto thy teſtimonies,</hi>
                  <pb n="450" facs="tcp:171186:109"/> how ſo? <hi>Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity:</hi> The way to have ones heart enclined to the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of God, is to turn away ones eyes from theſe outward vanities. Would you therefore meditate on God, and the things of God, then take heed that your hearts, and your hands, be not too full of the world, and the imployments thereof.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Laſtly, If you would meditate on God, and the things of God, go then to God for this skill of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Friends, There is an Art, and divine Skill of meditation, which none can teach but God alone: Would you have it, go then to God, and begg of God theſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Begg of God that he would change your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For if your ſoyl be not changed, nothing but weeds will grow ſtill, not the Flowers of meditation, but the weeds of vain thoughts; go firſt to God to change your Nature, to change your Soyl.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:171186:109"/> is a great friend to meditation. And then,</p>
               <p n="6">6. Beg of God the Spirit; for the Spirit is our Remembrancer, to bring all things to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. Thus do, and you ſhall in ſome meaſure be able to carry on this work of Meditation in a right way, with comfort and ſweetneſs. Theſe things by way of means: By way of means;— be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of your former work of meditation;— la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be more ſerious;— get a fixed heart and ſpirit;— lay out objects that may entertain your thoughts upon all occaſions;— ſtrengthen your love to, and delight in God;— labour to get Impreſſions, deep impreſſions made upon your ſouls, to the things of God;— and take heed that your hearts and hands be not too full of the world:— And then go to God for this skill of Meditation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But then fourthly, What are thoſe rules and directions that will help therein? How and in what way and manner ſhould this work of Meditation be carried on, with ſweetneſs and ſucceſs?</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, In all your Retirements (for the work of Meditation, is a work of Retirement) in all your meditations, be ſure that you retire in to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Don't retire into your retirements, as the Monks and thoſe do retire into a monkiſh devotion: But in all your Retirements, be ſure that you retire in to God himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed that you be not Legal in this work of Meditation. Legal work is ſowre work; Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion work is ſweet work. A man is legal in this work of Meditation, when he doth make it a mere task, when he doth in his meditation, think on God out of Chriſt: <hi>I thought upon God, and was troubled;</hi> to think upon God out of Chriſt, is ſowre work: I
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:171186:110"/> thought upon God and was not comforted, but was troubled, ſaith the Pſalmiſt. So that, to make our meditation work a meer task, is a legal work; to think upon God out of Chriſt, is a Legal work; and to paſs through God unto Chriſt, alſo is Legal. For, <hi>In the times of the Old Teſtament, they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me to Chriſt through God, but in the time of the New Teſtament, we go to God through Chriſt.</hi> An Old Teſtament way is a Legal way, would you therefore have this work of Meditation carried on with ſweetneſs; Take heed of a Legal ſpirit in this work of Meditation, which will ſowre all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be ſure of this, That nothing fall within the compaſs of your meditation, but what falls within the compaſs of the Scripture. It may be you may think of God, and you may think what God was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the world was made, this you have no Scripture for; therefore is no work for your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. — It may be, you think you are a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate; for ſay you, I have the marks of a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate upon me: <hi>But where doth the Scripture give any marks of a Reprobate? The Scripture gives marks of a wick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d man, that poſſibly may be converted.</hi> But now, If you would carry on the work of meditation in ſuch a way as it may be done with ſweetneſs, be ſure that it be bounded with the Scripture; and let nothing fall within the compaſs of your meditation, but what falls within the compaſs of the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In all your ſettled meditation, Begin with Reading, or Hearing.— Go on with meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, — End in prayer. For as Mr. <hi>Greenham</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Reading without Meditation, is unfruitful; Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without Reading, is hurtful; To meditate and to read without prayer upon both, is without bleſſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you do read and not meditate, then you wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> want good affections.</p>
               <pb n="453" facs="tcp:171186:110"/>
               <p>If you do meditate, and not read or hear, you will want good Judgment, and be apt to fall into ſome ill Opinions.</p>
               <p>If you do read, or hear, or meditate, and not pray, you will want the bleſſing of the Lord upon both: Read, or hear firſt; then meditate; and then pray upon both. I ſpeak of ſettled meditation, and let one be proportioned unto another. There muſt be a proportion between the one and the other, in a ſettled meditation; and therefore if that you would meditate rightly, I ſay in all your meditations, begin with reading, go on with meditation, and end with prayer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you would have this work of Meditation carried on with profit and ſweetneſs, joyne with your Meditation, the examination of your own ſouls, in caſe you meditate on God and Chriſt, think with your ſelves by way of examination, But have I an Intereſt in this? I have been now thinking and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating on the excellencies of Chriſt, but have I an Intereſt in him? Come Oh my ſoul, thou haſt been meditating on God, and on the excellencies of Chriſt, but haſt thou any ſhare, haſt thou any Intereſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Joyne examination with your Meditation, then it will be profitable, then it will be ſweet; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is but Contemplation, or but a ſtudy; but joyne examination with your Meditation, ſo 'tis ſweet, and ſo 'tis profitable.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Obſerve what thoſe times and ſeaſons are that are moſt fit for Meditation, and be ſure you lay hold thereon. Though Meditation-work is every dayes work, yet there are ſome times and ſeaſons that are more fit for Meditation. Shall I name Four or Five.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Look when the Lord hath made any deep Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:171186:111"/> upon your ſoul by word or work, then is a time for your meditation; for Impreſſion calls for meditation</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Morning is a fit time for Meditation before the World come in. What more fit for God than the beſt of time; the Morning is the beſt of time, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a fit time for Meditation on God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Sabbath Day is a fit time alſo for Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore the 92th <hi>Pſal.</hi> is appointed for the Sabbath, <hi>A Pſalm for the Sabbath Day,</hi> ſaith the Title to the <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The time of Gods ſpecial diſpenſations is a fit time for it; Look when there is a ſpecial diſpenſation of God abroad, either of Mercy or Judgment, then is a fit time for Meditation. In the 9th <hi>Pſal. The Lord is known by the Judgement which he executeth, the wicked is ſnared in the work of his own hands, Higgaion Selah.</hi> — whats that? it comes from the <hi>Heb. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gah,</hi> which ſignifies to <hi>Meditate.</hi> When the wicked are ſnared in the work of their own hands, here's wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k for meditation. Look (I ſay) when there is a ſpecial diſpenſation of God either in Mercy or Judgment, that's a fit time for meditation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Look what time that is that lies next, or near, or cloſe to, any great work or ſervice, that's a fit time for meditation: As for example. Suppoſe we be to receive the Lord's Supper: The time that lies next before it is a fit time for meditation. Suppoſe a man be to be call'd out for ſome great ſervice or Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The time that goes cloſe before it is a fit time for him to ſit down and meditate with himſelf upon the work: For the more a man doth prepare for a work, the more likely he is in reaſon to perform it well. Now, Meditation is a good preparation: Look therefore what that time is that immediately before, or cloſe to the work of the Lord, that's a fit time for
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:171186:111"/> Meditation.—Thus now you ſee what the ſpecial times are for the work of Meditation.—The time of Impreſſions—The morning time—The Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day—The time of ſpecial diſpenſations, either of Mercy or Judgment—And the time tha goes Immediately or next, or cloſe before the great work and ſervice of the Lord. And, If you would meditate rightly, obſerve what the fit times for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation are, and be ſure you lay hold thereon.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I'le name but one more. Though there is a great deal of profit and ſweetneſs to be found in this work of meditation, and it's every dayes work, yet take heed that you don't ſo meditate on one of Gods excellencies, as to neglect another; nor don't ſo ſpend your whole time in the work of meditation, that this work of meditation ſhould eat up other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes: God would have us riſe from this work of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, as from any other duty, with an hungry appetite. Friends, God would have us riſe hungry from every duty, and not glutted, variety is refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he hath given many duties that we may not pore upon one. In caſe therefore you have bin at the work of meditation, either God hath come in upon you with his ſpeciall Influence, or not: if he hath, praiſe the Lord for his AYtance, it's mercy that you have had one good thought of God, but Meditation is more than a thought, meditation is thought upon thought; praiſe God, that's the way to have more,— And In caſe that God hath not come in upon you in the work of meditation; then yet be not diſcouraged, for God would not have you glutted, and God would lead you to ſome other work, and one duty, one work, is not to eat up and devour another. I ſay with one; <hi>Let not your time be the meaſure or rule of your Meditation, but your Meditation the rule of
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:171186:112"/> your time;</hi> Yet take heed, that you don't ſpend ſo much time in muſing and conſidering, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as that this work of Meditation ſhould eat up any other Duty, but quicken thereunto. And thus you ſee ſome means, ſome helps, to this work of Meditation; Some Rules and Directions for the right carrying it on ſweetly: What now remains, but that you up and be doing; turn your hand to it. You have heard the duty proved: You have heard the ſweetneſs and profitableneſs thereof cleared: You have heard what Objects we are to lay our Thoughts out upon: And you have heard ſome means, as helps unto the Work: And ſome Rules and Directions for the carrying of it on: O then, you that never ſpent hour in meditation all your dayes, if there be any ſuch here; Now bethink your ſelves, and now give up your Thoughts to God. —You that have gone one year after another, and one week after another, and never ſpent any time in meditating on God or the things of God, O now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think your ſelves: And that you may do ſo, and be provoked hereunto, give me leave to lay down ſome Arguments and Motives to preſs both your ſouls and mine, unto this great work of Meditation. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are divers: Thus</p>
               <p>Firſt, Friends, The more acquaintance you have with this work of Meditation, the more time you will get, and the leſſe you will loſe. A man that hath the skill on't, need never loſe an hour. Who knows the worth of time? This little ſpot of time doth our Eternity depend upon: Yet, Lord, how many are there that loſe their precious hours and time— But what's the reaſon?—They have no hand at this work of Meditation: When their buſineſs is over, they might otherwiſe turn their hand to this
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:171186:112"/> work, and loſe no time. <hi>The more acquaintance you have with this work of Meditation, the more time you will get, and the leſſe you will loſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hereby, even by this work of Meditation, you ſhall get into the Secrets of divine things. There is a Secret and a Myſtery in ever Trade: A man don't know the Trade, till he knows the Secret and the Myſtery of it: It's ſaid, <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him.</hi> Knowledge brings us to the door of Truth: But Meditation hath us into the Houſe, and into all the Rooms thereof: Thereby (I ſay) you ſhall get into the Inwards, and the Secrets of the things of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thereby alſo you ſhall ſuck out the ſweetneſſe of all thoſe divine and precious things that you know. As a man by muſing on his Sins, ſucks out the ſweetneſs thereof; ſo by meditating on the things of <hi>God,</hi> you ſuck out the ſweetneſs of the things of <hi>God</hi> into your own ſouls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By this work of Meditation, you ſhall have a Teſtimony in your own Souls, that you are truly godly. <hi>Every man is what he is moſt in private.</hi> A good mans work lies moſt under-ground, lies moſt out of ſight. In the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the beaſts were clean that chewed the Cud, and unclean that did not chew the Cud. In the time of <hi>David,</hi> 'tis made the Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a godly man, <hi>He delighteth in the Law of the Lord, and therein doth he meditate.</hi> Hereby then, you ſhall have a teſtimony in your own hearts, that you are truly godly. But you ſhall not only have a teſtimony that you are truly godly, but practiſe it, and thereby you ſhall be very godly: for the more conſtant you are in godlineſs, the more godly you are. By the work of Meditation, you will be conſtant in the work of Godlineſs— The more extenſive your godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:171186:113"/> is, the more godly you are: Now by meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you can extend your thoughts, beyond your hands: As by ſinful muſings, a man can extend his thoughts beyond his power to practice; ſo by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on God and the things of God, a man may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his thoughts concerning godlineſs, beyond his power to act — As in ſin, a man by his thoughts may be naught where he hath not an outward power to be naught; ſo by holy meditation, a man may be good where he hath not a power in his hand to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. The Pſalmiſt ſaith, in the 45th. <hi>Pſalm, The Kings Daughter is all glorious within, her garment is of wrought gold, verſ.</hi> 13. Her clothing is of wrought gold, is not that glorious? clothing is outward, but ſaith he, <hi>ſhe is all glorious within;</hi> 'Tis not the wrought gold without makes her glorious, but ſhe is all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious within: Though the garment, and though her clothing be of wrought gold, yet her glory lyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Here lies the glory of a Chriſtian, to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous within:— And how can we have this inward Holineſs, Grace, and goodneſs, and Glory, unleſs we be verſed in this work of Meditation?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thereby alſo, you ſhall offer up your ſelves unto divine Imbraces; and upon this ground of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, will God give out his loves unto you: In <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>There will I give thee my Loves,</hi> v. 12.—There— where? <hi>Let us get up early to the Vineyards, let us ſee if the Vine flouriſh, whither the tender Grap appear, and the Pomgranates bud forth.</hi> Here's the publick Aſſembly.— What's this to meditation?— Yes, in the former <hi>v. Come my beloved, let us go forth into the Field, let us lodg in the Villages,</hi> places of Retirement; <hi>There will I give thee my Loves,</hi> upon the ground of Retirement. There will he give forth his loves. O! What a great mercy
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:171186:113"/> is here, by this work of Meditation, you do not onely offer up your ſelves unto Divine imbraces: But, <hi>There upon Meditation-ground, will God give out his loves unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Thereby alſo, your ſouls and hearts ſhall be ſubdued unto God: As in ſin, ſo here, Friends, It is not a ſinful thought that doth ſubdue my heart into ſin; 'tis not a ſinful ſuggeſtion that ſubdues my heart into ſin: But, <hi>A Complacential dwelling of ſinful thoughts in my heart, ſubdues my heart into ſin.</hi> So 'tis not a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient good thought that will ſubdue the ſoul, or the heart unto God; but it is a Complacential dwelling of good thoughts in the heart that doth ſubdue the heart unto God, and that's done by Meditation. Thereby therefore, I ſay, Your very hearts ſhall be ſubdued unto the Lord: Oh what a mercy is this!</p>
               <p n="8">8. By this work of meditation on God, and the things of God; <hi>You ſhall live on God:</hi> Poſſibly a man may come to the Court where the King is, and not live upon the King, becauſe he don't ſtay there; but thoſe that ſtay at the Court, they live upon the King, for they ſtay there. Now by a thought, I don't ſtay upon God; but by a frequeut meditation on God, I ſhall live in God; for then I ſtay by God, and I do ſtay on him.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Thereby alſo you ſhall have a conſtant relief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all your afflictions, both inward and outward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inward, Pſal.</hi> 143. <hi>Have mercy upon me, O Lord,</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>My ſpirit is overwhelmed within me, my heart within me is deſolate:</hi> What then?— <hi>I remember the dayes of old, I meditate on all thy works:</hi> Here lies the relief againſt ſpiritual fears, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmings of ſoul, even to meditate on God as one ought to do, in a right manner: I am overwhelmed, but I'le meditate on all thy works, and muſe on the work of thy hands.</p>
               <pb n="460" facs="tcp:171186:114"/>
               <p>As for the Outward afflictions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. the place cited before, <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>Princes alſo did ſit and ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, but thy Servant did meditate in thy Statutes.</hi> Reproach from an ordinary man, is affliction enough; but for Kings and Princes, to ſpeak againſt one, this is a great matter. What relief then? <hi>But thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant did meditate on thy Statutes.</hi> So that by this, you have a conſtant relief againſt both outward, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflictions. And,</p>
               <p n="10">10. Thereby alſo you ſhall be freed from that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, that <hi>God</hi> will take at your hands, if you don't meditate on him, and the things of <hi>God.</hi> Friends, If you don't meditate on <hi>God,</hi> and the things of <hi>God, God</hi> will take it very unkindly at your hands: What man that is abroad beyond Sea, hearing that his wife frolicks it at home, and never thinks on him, will not take it unkindly? We are abſent now from <hi>God,</hi> and to frolick and be vain, and go up and down, and have no thoughts on <hi>God,</hi> no meditation on <hi>God;</hi> How unkindly muſt <hi>God</hi> take this at our hands? 'Tis a ſleight, If a man ſpeak unto you, and you don't think of what he ſpeaks, 'tis a ſleight to him: So to read what <hi>God</hi> ſaith, or ſee what <hi>God doth,</hi> and not think on't, not to meditate on it; what is this but a ſleight unto <hi>God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Meditation,</hi> go together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.15. <hi>I will meditate in thy precepts, and have reſpect unto thy wayes.</hi> So then, The want of meditation, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on what <hi>God</hi> ſaith, and what <hi>God</hi> doth, is a great ſleighting of him, 'tis a want of reſpect, and <hi>God</hi> will take it unkindly:— And what then?— Why he will deal by you as you do by him; if you think not on him, he will not think on you; and in the day of your extremity, when you call and cry to him, becauſe you thought not of him, he will not think of you. But to end all.</p>
               <pb n="461" facs="tcp:171186:114"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> knows, and your own ſouls know, how you have lain muſing in the way of ſin; how ſome times you have lain deviſing miſchief upon your beds: How often you have chewed the Devils Cud; what ſwarms of unclean thoughts, of proud thoughts, of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving thoughts, have poſſeſſed your hearts? Oh friends! Shall we lie muſing upon our bed, in a way of ſin, and ſhall we not think, and muſe, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on God, and the things of God? What ſhall we not be the ſame for God, that ever we have been for ſin? O, we have had our ſinful muſing times, therfore now why ſhould we not have our holy muſings alſo?</p>
               <p>And to conclude all, Meditation, holy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a very great friend to heavenly Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Sweet meditation of God, is a very great friend to holy Converſation: Private meditation, a great friend to an outward holy Converſation.— Now then,— As ever you deſire, that the holineſs of your Converſation may be advanced; That you may be as godly now in your thoughts, as ever you have been ungodly.— That God may take nothing unkindly from you.— That you may have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant relief againſt all afflictions, both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. — That you may live on God.— That your hearts may be ſubdued into God.— That God may give out his Loves unto you.—That you may be very godly — That you may have a Teſtimony in your own ſouls, that you are truly godly; That you may ſuck out the ſweetneſs of all the things you know; That you may be let into the ſecret of Godlineſs, and not ſtand at the door of Knowledg onely.— That you may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſe a pretious hour, but redeem your time. Now to the work of Meditation: And you that have neglected it ſo long, be not aſhamed to begin it at laſt.</p>

               <p>Wherein he doth ſtrengthen his Faith, and the Iſraelites Faith in God.—And ſhews the miſery and frailty of mans life—petitions God for his mercy.</p>

               <p>A <hi>man is never fit to look upon the troubles of this World, and the miſeries thereof, till his heart be eſtabliſht in God by beleeving.</hi> This therefore he doth in the firſt place, by ſeveral Arguments of Comfort.</p>

               <pb n="463" facs="tcp:171186:115"/>
               <p>Faith finds that in God which we want here below, and that's the way to true Comfort.</p>
               <p>The Second is drawn from the eternity of Gods eſſence and beeing. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Before the Mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadſt formed the earth and the World, even from everlaſting to everlaſting, thou art God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third is drawn from our Reſurrection! Though now we die, and are deſtroyed, yet at the 3. <hi>v. Thou turneſt man to deſtruction, and ſay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Fourth is drawn from the ſhortneſs of the time that lies between our Death and the Reſurrection! for it will be ſaid, There's a great deal of time between our Death, and the Reſurrection: But ſaith he, you muſt account as God accounts, for at the 4th. <hi>v.

               <p>God is ſaid, <hi>To return,</hi> when after ſome Judgments for ſin, he doth ſhew forth ſome freſh tokens of his love and favour.</p>
               <p>God is ſaid <hi>To Repent, when he doth change his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Anger into Love.</hi> And this is that which the Pſalmiſt doth here moſt deſire: From whence, I take up this Doctrine or Obſervation.</p>
               <p>Obſ. <hi>When God is in any meaſure departed from his people, it is their great deſire, that God would return unto them, and repent him concerning his Servants.</hi> — For the clearing and proſecuting of which,</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall labour to ſhew you, that God doth ſometimes forſake, deſert, and depart from his own people for a time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they are very ſenſible of ſuch departures, and think it long.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That then, in the time of thoſe departures, their great deſire is that God would return, and</p>
               <p n="4">4. That when God doth return unto his people, then he doth repent him concerning his Servants; and</p>
               <p n="5">5. What we ſhould do in caſe God ſhould be in any meaſure departed from us, that he may return again unto us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As for the firſt: God doth ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and forſake, and depart from his people for a
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:171186:116"/> time. <hi>Not in regard of their Union, ſo he never departs; But in regard of Communion, and manifeſtation, ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he doth:</hi> Though nothing is hid from the <hi>heat</hi> of this Sun, yet our ſouls may be hid from the <hi>light</hi> of this Sun: God doth ſometimes depart from his own people.</p>
               <p>For firſt, He is the Sovereign Lord over all: And what if God will, <hi>to make his power and ſovereignty known among his own people,</hi> ſometimes withdraw, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, and depart from them. Two times you read in the Book of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> that Chriſt withdraws from the Spouſe: Once <hi>upon occaſion of her ſin, and ſecurity;</hi> And then ſhe meets with blows, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. Once upon an account of his <hi>meer pleaſure, Cant.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>As whom God will he ſhews mercy to, and whom he will he hardens: So whom God will he is preſent with, and whom he will he is abſent from, <hi>He is the Sovereign Lord over all.</hi> But</p>
               <p>Secondly, What if God will that his people ſhould have a <hi>taſte of hell</hi> in this life, that ſo they may be ſenſible of, and very thankful for their deliverance from hell, and the wrath to come. There are three things in hell — <hi>Torment of Body, — Horror of Conſcience, — Loſs of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By our Pains and Torments, Gouts and Stone, we think of the Torments of Hell, or may think.</p>
               <p>By the horror of Conſcience that we meet withall, we may think of the horror of Conſcience there.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Gods</hi> withdrawing, and <hi>Gods</hi> departing from us here, we may think of the loſſe of <hi>God</hi> for ever there.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are not in perfection here: <hi>In hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there is nothing but the preſence of God, and all the comforts there flow from that Fountain.</hi>— In hell there's nothing but the abſence of <hi>God,</hi> and all the
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:171186:117"/> miſeries there flow from that Fountain.— This life lyes between both. And what if <hi>God</hi> will (that we may be ſenſible of the great deliverance from the wrath to come) give us a taſte of hell, by his withdrawings and by his departings from us for a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I am ſure, 'tis very fit that we ſhould be conformed unto Jeſus Chriſt. As Chriſt was confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto us, in reference to <hi>our Temptations;</hi> ſo 'tis fit we ſhould be conformed to him, in reference to <hi>his Deſertions.</hi> Chriſt was deſerted, Chriſt was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Surely, the Diſciple is not above his Maſter. But</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I am ſure of this, That God loves to ſee the workings of all our graces, our Faith, and Love eſpecially: <hi>There are ſome graces that do not open nor ſhew themſelves, but in the Sunſhining day of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi> When the Sun ſhines, the <hi>Marigold</hi> opens. When the Sun ſhines, the Fiſh that lay at the bottom of the water in a cloudy day, ſwim at the top of the water, and are ſeen. In the Sunſhining day of <hi>Gods</hi> preſence, then <hi>our Thankfulneſs, our Joy, our Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance floats, and are to be ſeen upon the top of the water.</hi> But there are other graces, that are beſt ſeen when <hi>God</hi> withdraws, and when <hi>God</hi> is abſent,— Faith in <hi>God,</hi>— And love to <hi>God</hi> eſpecially.</p>
               <p>Faith in <hi>God,</hi> For Faith works beſt, when it works all alone, without the <hi>Auxiliaries of Comfort.</hi> 'Tis no great matter for a Wife to believe her Husband's Love, when he is at home, and daily and hourly ſhewing kindneſs: But when he is abroad, and abſent and ſhe hears not from him, then to believe his Love, is ſomewhat: So to believe the Love of <hi>God</hi> towards us, when he is preſent, is no great matter, though it's good: But when <hi>God</hi> is gone, when God is abſent, then to believe his love, is Faith, worthy of God, as <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
               <pb n="467" facs="tcp:171186:117"/>
               <p>Thus alſo, our love unto God doth and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: For when God is preſent with us, and ſhines upon us, then <hi>we ſee Gods love to us;</hi> but when God is abſent from us, by our longings after him, then <hi>we ſee our love unto God.</hi> Now I ſay, What if God will, to draw out all our graces, and that he may ſee the workings of our graces, Faith, and Love eſpecially; what if he will withdraw and abſent himſelf from his people for a time? But,</p>
               <p n="5">5. What if God will, for the good and benefit of others, withdraw and abſent himſelf, and depart from his own people? In the Book of the <hi>Cant.</hi> we find that when Chriſt doth withdraw from his Spouſe, and ſhe could not find him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.6. ſhe ſearches after him, enquires for him, makes great complaint: Then the Daughters of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſay, <hi>Whither is thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved gone, O thou faireſt among women? whither is thy beloved turned aſide, that we may ſeek him with thee?</hi> So long as he was preſent, others were not drawn on for to ſeek him with her; but now he is abſent, and ſhe looks after him, and complains for want of him, now others are drawn to enquire after him.</p>
               <p>And why ſo? But to teach us thus much, that God will ſo over-rule the deſertions of his people, that his <hi>with-drawment from them, ſhall draw others to him.</hi> And thus now you ſee, there is reaſon, and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why God ſhould ſome times depart from, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, and be abſent, even from his own people for a time: And that's the firſt thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Saints and People of God, are very ſenſible of his diſpleaſure: <hi>How long Lord?</hi> They are moſt ſenſible of this, they look upon it as a <hi>very tedious thing, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt afflictive, to lie under Gods depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> How long Lord?</p>
               <p>Words of Expoſtulation, note Affection, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:171186:118"/> if they come with an Ingemination: And ſo you have it in the 13 <hi>Pſalm, How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever; how long wilt thou hide thy face from me, how long ſhall I take counſel in my ſoul.</hi> Four <hi>how longs:</hi> How long, how long, how long, how long. 'Tis a very tedious thing, and moſt afflictive to the people of God, to lie under Gods departures.</p>
               <p>It was ſo with Chriſt: ye may meaſure the hearts of the Saints, by the heart of Chriſt. <hi>The Firſt in every kind, is the Rule of the reſt. Chriſt was the firſt of Saints.</hi> Now though our Saviour Chriſt met with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afflictions and troubles in his death, you ſhall find, he is moſt ſenſible of Gods departure: <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> He doth not ſay, O my Diſciples, why have you left me, and why have you forſaken me; but, my God, my God, why haſt <hi>thou</hi> forſaken me? That is not the greateſt affliction, that <hi>weak men</hi> account the greateſt: That is not the greateſt burthen, that a <hi>weak man</hi> accounts the greateſt, but that which a ſtrong man accounts the greateſt burthen, is the greateſt burthen. Why now, that the <hi>Rock of Ages,</hi> Chriſt himſelf ſhould complain under this of Gods forſaking; what doth this argue? When <hi>Paul</hi> cries out, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death:</hi> Will you not conclude thereby, that the body of Death was a great burthen, that the ſin of our Nature was a great burthen? So, when Chriſt himſelf ſhall cry out, and complain of Gods forſaking, and departing, will you not conclude then, ſurely this is a burthen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! This is that the Saints and People of God, are the moſt ſenſible of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the property of a gracious ſoul, to be moſt affected with the inſide, and the ſpiritual part of mercies, and of deliverances: Though God give
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:171186:118"/> them outward deliverances, they are not ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the outward part, as with the inſide, and the ſpiritual part of the deliverance. And therefore in <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth Iniquity, and paſſeth by the Tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage: he retaineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy.</hi> It was an outward deliverance that God gave them, but the Church is moſt affected with the ſpiritual part on't.</p>
               <p>And as they are moſt affected with the ſpiritual part of a Deliverance, ſo they are alwaies moſt affected with the inward, and the ſpiritual part of an Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. — What's that?— The Anger of God, the Diſpleaſure of God, the Deſertion of God, the Departing of God. This is the thing that the Saints therefore are the moſt affected with, and the moſt ſenſible of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That is moſt afflictive to a gracious ſoul, which is moſt contrary to him, and to his will; <hi>All that is affliction, which is contrary to ones will.</hi> It was no great matter in it ſelf, that <hi>Mordecai</hi> did not pull off his Hat, and bow his Knee to <hi>Haman;</hi> it was no great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it ſelf, but it was contrary to <hi>Haman</hi>'s pride, and that's an affliction that is contrary to ones will. Now what is the will, and what is the deſire of the Saints, but the preſence of God? <hi>That they may ever be at their Fathers Knee, that they may ever be in his Arms, and held in the Im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>races of his Love, held in his Smiles;</hi> this is the thing that they do moſt deſire. And therefore in the very beginning of the <hi>Cant. Kiſs me with the kiſſes of thy Mouth:</hi> This therefore, being the thing that they do moſt deſire, the contrary muſt be the moſt afflictive.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That muſt needs be moſt afflictive, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them in all their Injoyments: <hi>Without the preſence
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:171186:119"/> of God, they have no injoyment, their injoyments are as no injoyments;</hi> the preſence of God with them, is the top of all their injoyments. If the Sun be down, 'tis not all the Torches, and Candles lighted up, that will give you a day; and if God be gone, 'tis not all your Creature-comforts, will give you joy. <hi>Take away the word MY, and take away the word GOD; you take away the comfort of the word GOD, if you take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the word MY.</hi> And therefore, Whereas the Lord had uſed to call the Iſraelites <hi>his people,</hi> and God had a little forſaken them; he ſaith to <hi>Moſes, Thy people,</hi> and <hi>the people,</hi> but not <hi>my people.</hi> But then,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thereby the Saints and people of God, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to great temptations: <hi>When God goes, the Devil comes.</hi> And ſo far as God doth go, ſo much the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil comes; if God do forſake and depart from a man, as to final rejection, then the Devil comes in a way of poſſeſſion. If God departs from a man, in a way of deſertion, then the Devil comes in a way of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; as God goes, ſo the Devil comes. Now, Is it not a grievous thing for the Saints, and People of God, to be expoſed to Temptations? Thus they are by the departure of God, and by the abſence of God, by the withdrawments of God. No wonder therefore that Gods departure is the moſt afflictive to them. And that's the ſecond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But then thirdly, As the departings of God, are the moſt afflictive to a gracious ſoul; ſo when the Lord is in any meaſure departed, it is the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Saints and people of God, that God would return. Not that God would take away his hand, the Pſalmiſt doth not ſay ſo; <hi>We are afflicted, Lord, take away our affliction;</hi> no, <hi>but return, O Lord, how long.</hi> They do not ſay, We are in this or that diſtreſs; <hi>Take away this diſtreſs and miſery from us:</hi> No, <hi>But return,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:171186:119"/> O Lord.</hi> This is the great thing that they do moſt deſire: When God is gone in any meaſure, or departed from them, their <hi>great deſire</hi> is, that God would <hi>return</hi> unto them; and it muſt needs be ſo. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is the preſence of God, but the moſt deſirable thing in the world: <hi>When the dayes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing ſhall come from his preſence.</hi> 'Tis the preſence of Chriſt, that will make the Day of Judgment, a Day of refreſhing. <hi>God's preſence, is the Saints pleaſure:</hi> In it there is a filling up of our indigent Nature:— In it there is the obtainment of our laſt end, with the knowledge thereof:— In it there is an univerſal good. Gods preſence is the moſt deſirable thing in all the world: No wonder then, that when God is departed in any meaſure, the Saints ſhould above all things in the world, deſire that God would return again. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> God never returns empty handed to his people. If a Husband be long abſent from his Wife, he will not return empty handed; I am ſure, God will not return empty handed unto his people: When he hath ſtricken them, he will let out more love unto them, then ever before. It was a ſad and a ſharp diſpenſation, that the Basket of good Figgs ſhould be carried away Captive, with the Basket of bad Figgs; but ſee how God returns unto them, not empty handed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24. <hi>The word of the Lord came unto me, ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord, the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>like theſe good Figgs, ſo will I acknowledge them that are carried away Captive of</hi> Judah, <hi>whom I have ſent out of this place, into the land of the Chaldeans, for their good; for I will ſet mine eyes upon them for good. and I will bring them again to this Land; and I will build them, and not pull them down, and I will plant them, and not pluck them up; and I will give them an heart to know me, that I am
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:171186:120"/> the Lord, and they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God; For they ſhall return unto me with their whole heart.</hi> See how God returns! when he returns, he doth not return empty handed unto his people: When God returns unto you, he will not onely pay you the principal of your Injoyment; but will pay you all your forbearance-mony too. <hi>But,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly and eſpecially: Take the Saints and people of God, <hi>and where do they live, but in the love of Chriſts Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not of his benefits, not of his Comforts, but they live in the love of his Perſon;</hi> Look into the Book of the <hi>Cant.</hi> and you ſhall find, how the heart of Chriſt is drawn out in love to the Perſon of the Spouſe; <hi>Let me hear thy voice,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for thy voice is ſweet, and thy Countenance is comely: how fair is thy love, my Siſter, my Spouſe; thy lipps. Oh my Spouſe, drop as the Hony-Comb,</hi> and ſo he goes on inſiſting in his love upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>So doth the Spouſe alſo towards him, <hi>my beloved is altogether lovely,</hi> and as you read, <hi>my beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt among Ten Thouſand.</hi> And ſo ſhe goes on. Thus love is drawn out towards the Perſon of Chriſt: Now, If this be the ſpirit, and if this be the diſpoſition of the Saints and the people of God, that they live in love to the Perſon of Chriſt, then no wonder that when Chriſt is with-drawn, they do above all things deſire that he would returne again. This muſt needs be, for they live in the love of his Perſon, and not of his benefits, not of his Comforts; Therefore above all things they ſay, Return, O Lord, return.</p>
               <p>Fourthly when the Lord doth return unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he doth then Repent him concerning his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Return, O Lord, how long, and let it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thee concerning thy Servants, For the
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:171186:120"/> opening and cleering of this, four things briefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What it is for God to Repent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether God doth at any time repent, or will at any time repent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How it may appear that when God returns un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people, that then he will repent him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Servants. And,</p>
               <p n="4">4. How ſhould we know in the Day and time of Gods departure from us, that God will again return unto us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for the firſt: If you aske what it is for God to repent.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer. It is to change the diſpenſation of his anger.</hi> God don't repent by the changing of his affection, but he repents by the changing of his diſpenſation. As when a man is writing, and he blotts out what he hath written, he repents that he had wrote ſuch a thing; So when God is writing hard things againſt his people in a way of diſpenſation, and he ſhall blott out that diſpenſation, then God is ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: So it repented the Lord that he had made man, in the 6. of <hi>Gen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, If you aſk, Whether God doth, or will at any time repent.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> yes; Expreſsly, in the 32 <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. <hi>And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.</hi> 'Tis a direct Anſwer of prayer to the very words. At the 12. <hi>v. Moſes</hi> prayes; <hi>Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inſt thy people.</hi> And at the 14. <hi>v. The Lord repented of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l which he thought to do unto his people.</hi> God doth and will ſome times repent.</p>
               <p>Onely you muſt know; <hi>God will more eaſily repent of his Judgments, than of his Mercies.</hi> And you muſt know that the gifts of God are of two ſorts.—Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:171186:121"/> and Common gifts, and ſo God repents of them, and he takes them away, <hi>It repented the Lord that he had made man</hi>—Of the gifts of God that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern effectual vocation, ſo God repenteth not; For <hi>the gifts and callings of God are without repentance.</hi> Thoſe gifts that concern our effectual Vocation, thoſe God repents not of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But then Thirdly, how may it appear that when the Lord doth return unto his people, that then he will repent him concerning his Servants.</p>
               <p>Why that appears by the thing it ſelf. If a man ſay he will go from ſuch a Town and never return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and then do return, he doth repent him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the thing, by his return: And ſo concerning God. In the 18th <hi>Jer. At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pul down, and to deſtroy it, If that Nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</hi> Well,</p>
               <p n="4">4. But then 4thly. How ſhall we know in caſe God be abſent, or God be departed, how ſhall we be able in the time of Gods abſence, or departure, to know that God will return again. Suppoſe that God be withdrawn from my ſoul in particular, I am this day under a ſpiritual deſertion, how ſhall I know that God will return again to me. Or ſuppoſe that God have forſaken, and departed much from the Nation, how ſhall we know whether God will return again or no?</p>
               <p>Indeed it is a very hard thing to bear the departures of God; But yet if I did know that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again, I ſhould be comforted; How therefore ſhall I know, both in reference to my own ſoul in particular, and in reference to the Nation, that God will return again?</p>
               <pb n="475" facs="tcp:171186:121"/>
               <p>Here are two caſes, and I ſhall ſpeak all along to both.</p>
               <p>If your Queſtion do relate unto your own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſe and ſoul. I Anſwer thus;</p>
               <p>You may know it by your Relations. <hi>If you be in Covenant with God;</hi> God will return again to you though now he be abſent; <hi>Though he afflict you with Rods, his loving kindneſs will he not take away, nor ſuffer his faithfulneſs to fail.</hi> Will a Father or Mother leave their Child? no; I am ſure God will not. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was under a great diſpleaſure with his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, yet notwithſtanding at the laſt he <hi>could hold no longer,</hi> but he <hi>burſts out,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>I am your Brother Joſeph:</hi> And ſo though you be under ſome great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure from Chriſt, <hi>yet there is a time when Chriſt will break forth and ſay unto you, I am yous Brother Jeſus.</hi> And I ſay, if you be in Covenant with God, you may conclude it, for ſo doth the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>ult. I ſhall yet praiſe him.</hi> My ſoul, thou art caſt down and diſquieted, but be quieted, <hi>for</hi> I <hi>ſhall yet praiſe him.</hi>—Why, <hi>he is the health of my Countenance, and my God.</hi> You may know it then by your Relations. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though God or Chriſt be gon, and in a great meaſure departed from your ſouls, yet, <hi>If you cannot leave God, God cannot leave you.</hi> In our converſion, God comes to us before we come to him. But in Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie we depart from God before he departs from us. How is it therefore with you? Can you ſay truly, My ſoul cannot leave God, then conclude and ſay, God will return again, and cannot leave you. But</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though God be very much gon, and departed from you in a great meaſure; <hi>Yet if in the time of his abſence he doth ſend you letters and tokens of love, you
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:171186:122"/> may know for certain he will return again.</hi> Poſſibly God, or Chriſt may appoint an affliction to bring you a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or to bring you a meſſage of love in the time of his abſence—Poſſibly, he may appoint or order ſome providence to bring you a Token, or ſome meſſage of love.—Poſſibly he may order and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>upholding mercy,</hi> to be a pledge to you of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering mercy.</hi> And believe it, upholding mercy is alwaies a pledge of delivering mercy. How is it therefore with you, are you deſerted, is Chriſt gon; yet have you not had the upholding preſence of God all this while? then be of good Comfort, Chriſt is not gon but he will return again.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If your caſe and condition be ſuch, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you cannot find Chriſt, Chriſt is gon: though Chriſt be gon, and departed from you, and you cannot find him, <hi>yet, If you can direct others to the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him when you cannot find him, then certainly he is not gon, but he will return again unto you.</hi> The Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> ſeeks after Chriſt: ſaith ſhe, he hath withdrawn himſelf and I cannot find him. Chap. 5. The Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſay, <hi>whither is thy beloved turned aſide, that we may ſeek him with thee? —my Beloved is gon down into his Garden, to the beds of ſpices.</hi> Mark, ſhe could not find him her ſelf, and yet ſhe can direct others to the finding of him— What doth this ſignifie, but plainly teach us thus much, that though Chriſt be gon, and we cannot find him, yet if we can direct others to the finding of him, <hi>he is not quite gon,</hi> but he will return again. Now is it thus with you, when Chriſt is gon cannot you direct others to the finding of him? If you can, then build upon it, he is not ſo gon but he will return again.</p>
               <p>But then, Secondly, ſuppoſe that the Lord be departed
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:171186:122"/> from this Nation much, we are under a very great diſpleaſure of the Lord this day: God is departed from us, how ſhall we know now in the time of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, that he will return again to this Nation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you know how it is with a man that doth leave his houſe: though he go away, yet if his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren be there, and his goods be there, his Plate and his Jewels there, he will either come again to them, or ſend for them to himſelf! <hi>Believe it, Chriſtians, God hath a very great Cupbord of Plate in this Nation, Chriſt hath much plate in England, as much as in any Nation in the World, and he will not loſe his plate.</hi> There are three things very pretious in the eies of God—<hi>His truth—His worſhip—His Children:</hi> Such plate the Lord hath much of here, and he will not loſe his plate, therefore he will return again. Though he may afflict, and afflict ſorely, yet he will return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God will never go, while prayer ſtaies.</hi> If there be a praying ſpirit, and a ſpirit of prayer be up in this Nation, conclude that God is not quite gone, but he will return again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You may know it by the Providential Pledges, that the Lord ſends you. God was very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with <hi>Jonah;</hi> you know, he threw him over-board into the Sea; but then he appointed a Whale to receive him, to give him entertainment: <hi>To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a Chamber of Preſervation, even in the Belly of deſtruction.</hi> What did this ſignifie? It ſignified thus much, that God would deliver him afterwards; this Providence, was a Pledg for after-deliverance. So <hi>David</hi> was hunted in the Wilderneſs by <hi>Sau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> but in the Wilderneſs, God gave <hi>Saul</hi> into his hand? What did that ſignifie? <hi>That preſent deliverance, did ſignifie to</hi> David, <hi>an after-deliverance.</hi> Now though God be
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:171186:123"/> gone, and greatly departed from us here: Have you not many Providential Pledges of his Love? <hi>What think you of the houſe, that ſhould have been blown up with fire lately?</hi> What doth it ſignifie, but thus much, <hi>That God doth mind to reſtrain the remnant of their rage:</hi> How many Pledges, Providential pledges, have we had of Gods return; therefore let us ſay: Yet God will return again. But,</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. If your eſtate and condition be ſuch, upon which the Lord will deliver for his Names ſake, and with a Notwithſtanding; then why ſhould you not conclude that God will return again: Friends, <hi>There is a time when God will deliver his people, for his Names ſake;</hi> and with a notwithſtanding all their ſins, and notwithſtanding all his own diſpleaſures: <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, he ſaved them for his Names ſake,</hi> Pſal. 106.— And when is that, that God will deliver a people <hi>for his Names-ſake, and with a n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>twithſtanding?</hi>— Look into the 44. <hi>Pſal.</hi> and you ſhall ſee when. Look when a people do ſuffer for his Names-ſake, then God will deliver for his Name ſake: <hi>Ariſe for our help, and redeem us for thy Mercy ſake.</hi> Why? at the 22. <hi>v. For thy ſake we are killed all the day long, and accounted as Sheep for the ſlaughter:</hi> Therefore, Lord, ariſe for thy Name ſake. For, for thy ſake are we killed. When a people ſuffer for God's Names ſake, then God will deliver for his Names ſake, then God will deliver with a notwithſtanding.— How is it with you now? You are in a ſuffering day, but are not all your ſufferings for the Name of Chriſt? <hi>Be of good comfort then, though God may be departed, and your City deſtroyed, yet he is n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I anſwer briefly, Firſt, <hi>Be ſure of this, that you keep your door open, the door of your hearts open for Chriſt's return.</hi> When the Maſter is abroad, the ſervant fits up to keep the door open for his coming in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be ſure of this, that now in the time of Chriſts abſence, you neglect no duty <hi>though very unſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Be ſure of this alſo, that you do gather in upon Chriſt by all thoſe words, and by all thoſe things whereby he ſeems <hi>to put you away from him.</hi> As the Woman of <hi>Canaan, true Lord, but the Dogs eat of the Crumbs</hi>— which made Chriſt turn in again, <hi>Oh Woman, great is thy Faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi> But then,</p>
               <p n="6">6. Be ſure that you <hi>ſend unto him one way or other, and tell him that you are ſick of love</hi> unto his Perſon: Then he returns. And,</p>
               <p n="7">7.

               </p>
               <p>But then, Secondly, ſuppoſe it be the caſe of the Nation.</p>
               <p>God is departed in a great meaſure, who doth not ſee it? What ſhall we therefore now do that God may return unto us again.</p>
               <p>Friends, Truly it is not an eaſie thing to bring God back again, when he is in a way of diſpleaſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a people: The Lord was angry, and ſorely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with <hi>Jonah:</hi> The Mariners prayed, <hi>Jonah</hi> confeſt his ſin, and <hi>yet the ſtorm ceaſed not,</hi> yet God goes on. I ſay, 'tis not an eaſie thing to bring God back to a Nation, when he is once in a way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt a people.</p>
               <p>And ſome times the Lord will never return unto a people again: The caſe of the <hi>Gaderens</hi> in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Hogs: The whole City came unto Chriſt, and <hi>beſought him to be gone. And away he went, and we don't read that ever he came there again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes he will return again, but with reſerves of after-Judgments: In <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed, and the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people, <hi>v.</hi> 14.

               </p>
               <pb n="471" facs="tcp:171186:124"/>
               <p>Well but then, what ſhall we do? It is too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, God is in a great meaſure gone from us, and departed from us, what ſhall we do now that God may return again unto this Nation?</p>
               <p>Firſt, Be ſure that you make your peace with Chriſt. Chriſt is this day offended, his Goſpel and Inſtitutions trampled upon. <hi>A Prophet will the Lord your God raiſe up among you, hear ye him; if not, he will not pardon you;</hi> that is, Chriſt. He that ſins againſt the great Remedy, ſhall be judg'd without remedy: <hi>Chriſt is the great Remedy;</hi> It is a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing to ſin againſt Chriſt. <hi>O,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, how often would I have gathered you, and you would not be gathered; your houſe is left unto you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate.</hi> And in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. you read, That after that great invitation to the Supper, thoſe that were invited refuſed, <hi>They made light of it, went their wayes: and the remnant took his ſervants, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them ſpitefully, and ſlew them: But when the King heard thereof, he was wroth, and he ſent forth his Armies, and deſtroyed thoſe Murderers, and burnt up their City.</hi> It is a Goſpel quarrel: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, Is the Lord gone and departed from us? O make your peace with Chriſt, it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> that is offended: O make your peace with Chriſt, elſe never look the Father ſhould return again. But then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you deſire that God may return again unto you, Then let us all return unto the Lord with all our hearts, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. <hi>Therefore alſo now, ſaith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your heart, with faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with weeping, and with mourning: Who knoweth if he will return, and repent, and leave a bleſſing behind him?</hi> Who knows, if you will turn
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:171186:125"/> unto him with all your heart, but he will return to you, and leave a bleſſing behind him?</p>
               <p>But look into <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6. <hi>Come, and let us return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up; after two dayes will he revive us, in the third day he will raiſe us up, and we ſhal live in his ſight.</hi> God will return.</p>
               <p>Well, but what aſſurance have we of it? are we certain God will return? — Yes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>His go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth is prepared as the morning.</hi> As ſure as a Morning is after Night, ſo ſure will God return: his going forth is prepared as the Morning; as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he will return as the Morning doth.</p>
               <p>I, but when will God return?</p>
               <p>In due ſeaſon: <hi>He ſhall come unto us as the Rain, as the latter and former Rain unto the earth,</hi> that is, he will return in due ſeaſon, his return of love ſhall be as the Rain, as the former and the latter Rain in their ſeaſon. Would you now therefore, that God ſhould return to you, O now do you return unto God.</p>
               <p>And that you may do ſo, only thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Be ſure of this, that you <hi>pray and beleeve, beleeve and pray.</hi> Some pray, but do not believe; ſome ſay they believe, but they do not pray. That which prayer cannot do, nothing can do; and <hi>That which faith will not do, prayer cannot do.</hi> The pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of faith ſhall heal the ſick; and who knows but it may heal a poor ſick Nation alſo: And therefore I ſay, pray and beleeve, and believe and pray.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be ſure of this, that in all your addreſſes unto God in prayer, <hi>you come to the bottome in the matter of your Confeſſion.</hi> If you have dayes of faſting, and prayer, and humiliation, be ſure that you come
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:171186:125"/> to the bottome in the matter of your Confeſſion, to confeſs the Original ſin of all the diſpleaſure that is come upon us: Otherwiſe, though you faſt, and pray, and confeſs, yet if you do not confeſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail that ſin which is the original of all our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, you do but cry <hi>Lapwing</hi> cry, fartheſt off from the Neſt, and it will do us no good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be ſure of this alſo, That you put away the evil of your doings, and do the contrary good; put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the evil of your doings, eſpecially your <hi>Aſhta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth.</hi> Friends, though you faſt and pray, and humble your ſelves; if you do not reform, all your faſting and prayer will not bring God back again. All the dayes of faſting and prayer that you keep, will do nothing, unleſs there be reformation. Yet I confeſs ſtill, <hi>God muſt have a latitude,</hi> and he will ſome times ſave and deliver before we are prepared for it; but I ſay, ordinarily, though you faſt, and pray, and cry never ſo much, yet if you do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, all your prayers will not do: And though you do reform, yet if you do not reform, and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your <hi>Aſhtaroth,</hi> that ſin that hath brought this diſpleaſure, your Reformation will not do. And though you do thus alſo, yet if you do not do the contrary good, it will not ſerve. Look to that therefore.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be ſure of this, That you go out of your ſelves, and <hi>lay down all your worldly intereſts at the feet of the Lord,</hi> ſaying, Come Lord, <hi>Return O Lord:</hi> not return, O my <hi>Trade</hi> return; not return, O our <hi>Ships</hi> return; not return, O our <hi>Peace</hi> return; but return <hi>O Lord,</hi> return <hi>O Lord.</hi> Friends, the more you go out of your ſelves, the more fit you are for God to return unto you.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:171186:126"/>5. And to conclude it, If you deſire that God ſhould return unto you, and that you may return to God, go then to God, and pray, and ſay, Turn us O Lord, and we ſhall be turned. And thus I have ſpoken to this caſe.</p>
               <p>Yet there is one thing more. It is a tedious thing to lye under Gods departure: There may be hopes that God may return again; But what ſhall we do in the interim till God returns again?</p>
               <p>I will briefly ſpeak to it, and have done.</p>
               <p>If your Queſtion do relate unto your particular Souls, and you ſay, God is now gone from my ſoul, what ſhall I do in the interim till God return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?</p>
               <p>Firſt, be ſure that you carry it as the afflicted Spouſe of Chriſt in the abſence of your husband; and for that you may read at large in the book of the <hi>Canticles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Be ſure of this, That you maintain your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and let not the ſenſe of your intereſt in God and Chriſt be diſſolved. Return O Lord, how long! and let it repent thee concerning <hi>thy ſervants.</hi> Still they keep their intereſt, <hi>Thy ſervants</hi> ſtill. And ſo the Spouſe, <hi>I am my Beloveds, and my Beloved is mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Be ſure of this, That you never come to ſay, God will never return again; though you ſay, <hi>Lord, how long!</hi> yet never ſay, God is gone, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn no more. Poor drooping, afflicted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted ſoul, be ſure of this, that you never ſay, God will never return; lo, he cometh leaping over the Mountains, over difficulties to you; <hi>Only be you willing to go leaping over the Mountains of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties for to meet with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="475" facs="tcp:171186:126"/>
               <p>And 2. If your queſtion do concern the publick, or the Nation, What ſhall we do till God do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Then go and lament after God. Is God gone and is God departed in a great meaſure from this Nation? now go and lament after God. Twenty years when the Ark was taken, the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> lamented after God in the Ark. How long how long God may ſtay at a diſtance from us, God only knows; in the interim let us all now go and lament after God. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Be ſure that you keep his Ambaſſadors with you. When he calls home his Ambaſſadors, he proclaims Warr againſt a Nation;</hi> but ſo long as he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Agents among you, he is not quite gone. And</p>
               <p n="3">3. If ever God begins to return to us again, be thankful for the beginnings of his return. He that is thankful for little, ſhall have much; and he that is thankful for the beginnings of return, ſhall have a whole return. Thus do then, and who knows but that the Lord may yet return, and leave a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing behind him? That he may do ſo, let us now pray, and ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Return O Lord, how long, and let it repent thee concerning thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi>

               <p>From whence then I take up this Note or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That it is a ſweet thing, and worthy of all our thankful acknowledgements to be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the bleſſings of Gods goodneſs, or Gods good bleſſings.</p>
               <p>Preventing mercy is ſweet mercy, ſoul-refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy, which a thankful gracious heart doth well obſerve, and in the obſervation thereof is much refreſhed therewithall.</p>
               <p>For the opening and proſecution of which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, firſt I ſhall labour to ſhew that it is no new thing for God to walk in the way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting mercy with the Children of Men. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> How, and in what reſpects God will prevent us with his mercies, or his bleſſings. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What thoſe choiſe bleſſings are, wherewith God will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Children of Men. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Why God will carry on the work of his mercy in a way of preventing Love. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> What there is in this preventing Love, that ſhould be ſo ſweet and ſoul-refreſhing to a thankful gracious heart. And <hi>Sixthly,</hi> In caſe that God hath prevented any of us with his love or mercy, what is our duty that doth flow from thence.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="478" facs="tcp:171186:128"/>1. It is no new thing for God to walk in a way of preventing love and mercy with the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men: Thus he hath alwayes dealt, doth deal, and will deal ſo; thus he hath alwayes dealt, ſo with the World, ſo with the Nations of the World, ſo with great Towns and Places, ſo with Families, and ſo with particular Souls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for the World; Did not God firſt come with his mercy to the World, before the World made after it? <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his onely begotten Son:</hi> But how did he give this gift? Did we beg it firſt, did we ſeek it firſt, or did he firſt prevent us with it? When <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the World in <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, fallen, did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and the World firſt go to God for Chriſt, or for the promiſe of Chriſt; or did God firſt give out the promiſe of Chriſt, before <hi>Adam</hi> or the World ſought it? <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpents head;</hi> God firſt gave out this promiſe of Chriſt, before <hi>Adam</hi> or the World ſought it. Thus in regard of the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as he hath dealt thus with the World, in regard of preventing mercy, ſo with the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the World: with the Nation of the Jews; ſo in the 16 of <hi>Ezek. When thou layedſt in thy blood, and no eye pittied thee, I paſſed by thee, and ſaid unto thee, live.</hi> So when the Nation of the Jews ſhall yet be converted again: <hi>He is found of thoſe that ſeek him not:</hi> it is ſpoken of the calling of the Jews. And as for the Nations of the Gentiles, ſayes our Saviour Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>go teach all Nations.</hi> Did the Nations of the Gentiles come to Chriſt, and ſay, Lord, the Nation of the Jews have reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thee, now then let the Goſpel come to us, and
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:171186:128"/> we will receive it? No, but ſayes our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Go, teach all Nations,</hi> whatever they be, Rich or Poor, High or Low, whatever they be, <hi>Go teach all Nations, and I will be with you,</hi> for their Converſion, for their Salvation, <hi>to the end of the World.</hi> Thus in regard of Nations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So alſo in regard of Towns, great Towns, Places, Corporations. What worſe Town then that of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> which afterward was exalted to Heaven? But did <hi>Capernaum</hi> firſt come to Chriſt, or did Chriſt firſt go to <hi>Capernaum?</hi> Chriſt firſt went to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. Ye read of ſeveral Towns in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles that did receive the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel by the hands of the Apoſtles, <hi>Iconium, Derbe, Lyſtra;</hi> but did theſe Towns firſt ſeek to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and ſay, Pray come and Preach Chriſt to us, or did the Apoſtles firſt go to them? The Apoſtles firſt went with Commiſſion from God to them. Thus in regard of Towns.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And as God dealt thus with Towns, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Towns and Corporations with the means of Grace, when they never thought on it, ſo in regard of Familes. Who doth not know how God by his mercy did prevent the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the Jaylor, converting that Family by his preventing Love? Who doth not know how God dealt by <hi>Zacheus</hi> and his Family: <hi>Zacheus</hi> got up the tree, may be, in curioſity among the multitude to ſee Chriſt go by, but Chriſt ſeeing him, invites himſelf to his houſe, <hi>Come down</hi> Zacheus, <hi>for to day I muſt abide at thy houſe.</hi> Did <hi>Zacheus</hi> firſt invite Chriſt? or did Chriſt firſt invite himſelf? Chriſt firſt invited himſelf. Thus in regard of Families.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:171186:129"/>5. And as for particular ſouls, you know how it was with <hi>Mathew</hi> the Publican ſitting at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of Cuſtome; Come and follow me, ſays Chriſt, preventing of him. And you know how it was with <hi>Paul, I was a Blaſphemer, and I was a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but I obtained Mercy:</hi> How ſo? Did he ſeek it firſt? No, ſayes he, I went breathing out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt the people of God, and God met me, And unhorſed me, God prevented me with his grace and mercy: Thus <hi>Paul.</hi> And pray tell me, what do you think of that whole Chapter, <hi>Luke</hi> 15? There are three parables; the parable of the loſt Groat, of the loſt Sheep, and of the loſt Son. The Woman loſt her Groat, and ſwept to find it; but did the Groat make firſt towards the woman, or the woman make after the Groat firſt? The Shepherd loſt his Sheep; but did the Sheep make firſt after the Shepherd, or the Shepherd after the Sheep? Indeed it is ſaid concerning the loſt Son, that he firſt takes up a reſolution, <hi>I will return home to my Father;</hi> but when his Father ſaw him afar off, he ran and met him, and imbraced him, and welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him home; Why? but to ſhew that the work of Grace and Mercy ſhall be all along carryed on in a way of preventing love. Thus it was with the World from the beginning, thus with the Nations of the Jews and Gentiles, thus with great Towns and Corporations, thus with whole Families, and thus with particular Souls: It is no new thing therefore for God to walk in a way of preventing love towards the children of men. That is the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Well but then ſecondly, How, and in what reſpects will God prevent us with his
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:171186:129"/> mercies, or with his good bleſſings?</p>
               <p>He will prevent us with his Mercies,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In reference to our own deſervings; when we deſerve evil, we ſhall receive good. Is it not a great prevention, when a man ſhall deſerve evil, to receive good? Thus will God deal with men ſometimes: <hi>He hath not dealt with us after our ſins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</hi> Did not <hi>Moſes</hi> deſerve a ſharp chiding, and to be beaten out of his excuſes, when God ſent him upon his work, and he ſtood excuſing the matter ſo long? <hi>Exodus</hi> 4. he ſaid, <hi>O my Lord, ſend I pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt ſend: and the anger of the Lord was handled againſt Moſes:</hi> What was the iſſue of it? Inſtead of blows, mercy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of chiding and threatning, a promiſe; <hi>And he ſaid, is not</hi> Aaron <hi>the Levite thy Brother, I know that he can ſpeak well, and lo, behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and when he ſeeth thee he will be glad in his heart; and thou ſhalt ſpeak unto him, and put words in his mouth, and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach ye what ye ſhall do:</hi> Here is good in the ſtead of evil. Thus God prevents us with his mercies, in reference to our own deſervings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As God doth prevent us, thus in reference to our own deſervings, ſo he doth prevent us alſo in reference to his own proceedings of common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Look when God doth give in a mercy, that is beyond the reach of the ſecond cauſe, that is ſtronger or greater then the root of the ſecond cauſe will bear, or beyond common providence, then God is ſaid to prevent us with his mercy: Now thus God doth many times give in a mercy,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:171186:130"/> that the <hi>Root of the ſecond cauſe cannot bear.</hi> So he gave <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a Child, and <hi>Sarah</hi> a Child, when they were old; <hi>With this ſtaff came I over this brook</hi> (ſayes <hi>Jacob) and lo, I am become two bands.</hi> And thus <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid, <hi>A</hi> Syrian <hi>ready to periſh was my Father</hi> (Deuteron. 26.5.) <hi>and he went down into</hi> Aegypt, <hi>and ſojourned there with a few, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came there a Nation, Great, Mighty, and Populous.</hi> A <hi>Syrian</hi> ready to periſh was my Father: As if a man ſhould ſay, I came here to <hi>London</hi> poor, having but my Pen and Inkhorn by my ſide, and now I am riſen up to a great Eſtate, beyond all my own Parts, Wits, and Endeavours, for the Lord hath prevented me with the bleſſings of his goodneſs. Thus God doth ſometimes prevent us with his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in reference to his own proceedings of common Providence, or the courſe of Nature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And then again <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As the Lord doth thus prevent us with his mercy in reference to his own proceedings of common providence, ſo he doth prevent us with his mercy in reference to our own preparedneſs. Look when God doth give in a mercy that we are not prepared for, then God is ſaid to prevent us with his mercy. Now was it not a great and choice mercy for the Ark to be brought home again to <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Yet notwithſtanding you ſhall find they were not prepared for it; before they were prepared, God gave them in the Mercy, the Ark came back, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. <hi>Chapter,</hi> but their preparation you read of in the 7 <hi>Chap. And</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel <hi>ſaid to all the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>if you do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the ſtrange Gods, and</hi> Aſhtaroth; and the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did put away <hi>Baalim</hi> &amp; <hi>Aſhtaroth,</hi> and ſerved
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:171186:130"/> the Lord onely. This was after the Ark came home; ſo then the Ark returned before they were thus prepared. And you know what is ſaid in the 57 of <hi>Iſa. For the iniquity of his Covetouſneſs I was wroth, and ſmote him, I hid me and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart:</hi> What then? verſ. 18. <hi>I have ſeen his wayes and will heal him, I will lead him alſo, and reſtore Comforts to him, and to his Mourners;</hi> over, and beyond all preparations, for he went on frowardly in the way of his heart, and he was not prepared but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his want of preparation, I have ſeen his wayes and will heal him, and will reſtore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to him, and to his Mourners. Thus God doth ſometimes prevent us with his mercy, in reference to our own preparedneſs for his mercy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As God doth prevent us with his mercy, in reference to our preparedneſs for his mercy, ſo he doth prevent us with his mercy, in reference to all our Prayers. Look when God gives in a mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we pray for it, then God is truly ſaid to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent us with his mercy. It is ordinarily ſaid, God will not ſet in his mercy before our Oven be hot; but if God ſhould never ſet in his mercy till our Oven and Hearts be hot in Prayer, we had been an unredeemed people to this day: though God will anſwer Prayer, yet he will be found alſo of them that ſeek him not. Do ye ſay, why then ſhould we pray? I anſwer, that you are to pray, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it is your duty to pray, but, <hi>the more God works in an extraordinary way, the more it is our duty to be found in the uſe of ordinary means:</hi> And what if I ſay, that the ſame mercy may come as an anſwer of prayer, and yet in a way of preventing
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:171186:131"/> love too? What ſay you to the caſe of <hi>Hezekiah?</hi> When he was ſick he prayed, and God heard his prayer, and health came as an anſwer of prayer, and yet he was prevented, for fifteen years more God gave in to him, which was beyond his prayer. You know how it was with <hi>Zacharias;</hi> ſayes the Lord, <hi>I have heard thy prayer,</hi> and gave him a Child, yet he did not pray for a Child, for he could not believe that he ſhould have a Child; ſo that God gave him a Child in a way of <hi>preventing mercy,</hi> and yet it was in anſwer of prayer too. So here in the Text, <hi>Thou haſt given him his hearts deſire, and haſt not with-holden the requeſt of his lips, for thou haſt prevented him with the bleſſings of thy goodneſs;</hi> Why? why although the mercy received may be an anſwer of prayer in regard of the <hi>body</hi> of it, yet it may come in a way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting love, as to the <hi>moreneſs</hi> of it; ſo it was with <hi>David,</hi> ſo with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and ſo with <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias.</hi> That's a fourth thing, God doth ſometimes prevent, as in reference to our prayer, giving in mercy beyond all our prayers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And then fifthly, As God doth prevent us in reference to our prayers, ſo in reference to our believing thoughts or expectances. <hi>When the Lord turned the Captivity of Zion, we were like them that dreamed:</hi> why were we as them that dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Why, truly we never looked for it, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it, we did not think on it, it was beyond all our expectations. Thus God doth prevent us ſometimes in reference to our expectances, to our faith, and to our thoughts.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As he thus prevents us with his mercy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to our thoughts, and faith, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:171186:131"/> ſo in reference to his own promiſes, and the conditions thereof; if I promiſe a man a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon a condition, and do that kindneſs for him when he hath not performed the condition, then I prevent him with kindneſs. Now the Lord hath promiſed many a mercy upon a condition, and yet given the mercy when we have not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the condition; <hi>I ſaid</hi> (ſayes David) <hi>I would confeſs my ſin, and thou Lord forgaveſt my ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> Lord, thou haſt made a promiſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, upon condition of our confeſſion and humiliation; I did not go ſo far, I did but ſay, I would confeſs my ſin, and thou <hi>prevented'ſt</hi> me with thy forgiving Love. Thus now you ſee, how, and in what reſpects God doth prevent us with his mercy; he doth prevent us with his mercy in reference to our deſervings, in reference to his own proceedings of <hi>Common Providence,</hi> in reference to <hi>all our Prayers,</hi> in reference to <hi>our Faith and Expectance,</hi> in reference to <hi>our Prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and in reference to his <hi>own Promiſes,</hi> and the conditions thereof. That's the Second.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Well but then thirdly, what are thoſe choice bleſſings, wherewith God will prevent his people?</p>
               <p>What not? But the <hi>greater</hi> the bleſſing is, the more it is <hi>ſteeped in Preventing Love.</hi> There are <hi>outward</hi> bleſſings, and there are <hi>inward</hi> bleſſings, there are <hi>temporal</hi> bleſſings, and there are <hi>eternal</hi> bleſſings; Now though the preventing love of God doth ſhine forth in all, yet the greater the bleſſing or the mercy is, the more it is <hi>irradiated</hi> with the <hi>beams</hi> of preventing Love.</p>
               <p>Will ye inſtance?</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="486" facs="tcp:171186:132"/>1. Firſt, Will ye inſtance in the great matter of our <hi>Redemption?</hi> What greater mercy or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing then our <hi>Redemption,</hi> in and by Jeſus Chriſt? that's of Grace; <hi>in whom we have Redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of our ſins, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the riches of his Grace.</hi> And when Chriſt came into the World in reference to our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to take our Nature upon him, do but ſee what a pack of wicked men were then extant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, in the <hi>Luke</hi> 3.1. <hi>Now in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of the Reign of</hi> Tiberius Caeſar, (there s one) Pontius Pilate <hi>being Governour of</hi> Judea, (there's another) <hi>and</hi> Herod <hi>being Tetrarch of</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee, (there's another) <hi>and his Brother</hi> Philip <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch of</hi> Iturea, Annas <hi>and</hi> Caiphas <hi>being High-Prieſts, the Word of God came unto</hi> John <hi>the Son</hi> of Zacharias <hi>in the Wilderneſs.</hi> And why was Chriſt born in ſuch a time as this, and among ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but all to ſhew, that the work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was to be carried on in a way of Prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or will ye inſtance in the matter of our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion:</hi> What greater mercy or bleſſing then our <hi>Converſion?</hi> yet look into the 33 of <hi>Job,</hi> and you ſhall ſee, how that Mercy comes ſwimming down the ſtream of preventing Love. <hi>God ſpeaketh once, yea twice, and yet man perceiveth it not;</hi> What then? <hi>In a dream, in a viſion of the night, when deep ſleep falleth upon men, in ſlumbrings upon the bed; then he openeth the ears of men, and ſealeth their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Or will ye inſtance in the matter of our <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification:</hi> What greater mercy or bleſſing then that of our <hi>Juſtification?</hi> Yet this alſo comes

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Or will ye inſtance in the matter of our <hi>Sanctification?</hi> What greater mercy then to be truly ſanctified? Yet this alſo comes ſwimming down the ſtream of preventing Love; <hi>I will waſh ye with clean water: Such and ſuch were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified in the Name of the Lord.</hi> This alſo in a way of preventing Love.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Will ye inſtance in the matter of <hi>Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?</hi> What greater mercy t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>en for a <hi>poore drooping ſoul</hi> to be <hi>truly comforted?</hi> This alſo comes in a way of preventing Love; e're <hi>ever I was aware,</hi> before I was aware, ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>My Soul was as the Charets of</hi> Aminadab; I was unwilling to receive the Promiſe, my Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be comforted, but, <hi>e're ever I was aware, my Soul was as the Charets of a willing people, of</hi> Aminadab, that is of a willing people. When Chriſt was dead, how ſad was <hi>Mary;</hi> Chriſt did but come unto her, and ſay, <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſhe was comforted.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Will ye inſtance in the Revelation of the <hi>truths of the times?</hi> What greater bleſſing, then
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:171186:133"/> for a man to be well acquainted with the <hi>truth of the times,</hi> in oppoſition to Antichriſt? Now ſayes <hi>John</hi> in the 1 of <hi>Revel.</hi> (when theſe truths were given out) <hi>I heard a voice behind me;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was aware God prevented me, acquainting me with theſe truths of the Revelations.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Or will ye inſtance in <hi>outward bleſſings or mercies?</hi> then I'le appeal to you; In the great turnings of your lives, hath not God prevented you with his bleſſings? It is true, we are to trade in a way of Prayer to gain outward bleſſings, and mercies; but I ſay, when ever did you meet with any great turn of your life, but it was caſt by preventing Love before Prayer came in? So that do ye ask what are thoſe choiſe bleſſings wherewith God will prevent his people? You ſee here what they are. So I have done with the third thing.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Now Fourthly, Why will God carry on the work of his Mercy in a way of <hi>Preventing Love?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Becauſe the <hi>heart</hi> of God is <hi>full of love</hi> to the children of men. Ordinary love will ſhew kindneſs upon kindneſs; but where the heart is full of love, it <hi>delights to prevent the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon loved with kindneſs.</hi> Now the heart of God is full of love for the children of men. That's one thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God will ſo carry on the work of his Grace and mercy, that all his mercies and bleſſings now may be conformed to the <hi>womb that bare them.</hi> The Child follows the womb that bare it: The <hi>firſt in every Kind is the Rule of the reſt.</hi> Now <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> is the <hi>womb</hi> of all our mercies; and doth not
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:171186:133"/> preventing Love ſway there? <hi>I have loved</hi> Jacob, <hi>and hated</hi> Eſau, before they had done either good or evil; there's preventing love. Now I ſay, God will ſo carry on the work of his mercy, that all his mercies and bleſſings may be conformed to their <hi>firſt original Election,</hi> and there preventing mercy is very ſweet.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But thirdly, God will ſo carry on the work of his mercy, as it may be <hi>moſt taking</hi> and <hi>effective</hi> upon the ſouls of the children of men; and what is more taking then preventing love? What more <hi>Operative,</hi> what more <hi>Powerfull,</hi> what more tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I ſay? You know the Parable; ſome were invited to the Supper, and ſome not invited, ſome came, and ſome came not; who were thoſe that came? who were thoſe that came not? thoſe that came not, were ſuch as were invited; thoſe that came, were ſuch as were in the <hi>Lanes, High-wayes</hi> and <hi>Hedges, compelled to come in.</hi> Ay, preventing love is the moſt taking; now God will ſo carry on the work of his mercy, as it may be moſt tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and moſt effective upon the ſouls of the children of men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Again, God will ſo carry on his mercy, as that it may be <hi>holding and ſure.</hi> The more any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is laid <hi>upon that which is in God himſelf,</hi> and the leſs laid upon that which is in us, the more <hi>holding and ſure</hi> it is: Now Mercy laid upon Grace is ſure, and therefore God will carry on the work of his Mercy in a way of preventing love, that his mercy may <hi>be ſure,</hi> that it may be <hi>holding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, God will ſo carry on the work of his mercy, as that it may be moſt <hi>ingaging,</hi> and moſt <hi>obliging</hi> with the hearts of men. What is
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:171186:134"/> there in all the world that is more <hi>ingaging</hi> to an ingenious ſpirit <hi>then Grace?</hi> And what is there more gracious then <hi>preventing love?</hi> Thereby a ſoul is engaged to God. Ah ſayes a poor ſoul, I was going on in the way of my ſin, lay <hi>ſnort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in my ſin, and never thought on the good wayes of God, unleſs it were to <hi>oppoſe</hi> them, and ſpeak againſt them; but then, before I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, I know not how, God did reveal himſelf, and his wayes to me; <hi>Oh now what ſhall I do for God!</hi> I will ſpend, and be ſpent for God; <hi>any thing for Chriſt,</hi> who hath thus overcome me with his <hi>preventing love.</hi> Of all thoſe that are called the Ancients, <hi>Auſtin</hi> did moſt magnifie the Grace of God; <hi>Bradwardin</hi> called him the <hi>Son of Grace;</hi> and of all in thoſe dayes, none that we read of <hi>taſted</hi> ſo much of the preventing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God as he: When he was young he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the mortification of his ſin, and yet he confeſſes that he <hi>ſecretly</hi> deſired that God would not grant his prayer, yet God <hi>prevented</hi> his prayer. Another time being alone, he heard a voice ſaying, <hi>tolle lege, tolle lege,</hi> take and read, take and read; and he opened the Bible, and pitched upon ſome words in the firſt of <hi>John,</hi> that proved the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Converſion.</hi> Another time going a Journey, he miſſes his way, and miſſing his way, he eſcaped his Enemies that lay in the way for him; ſeveral times God prevented him, inſomuch that he brake out into this expreſſion, <hi>Lord, I did not firſt come to thee, but thou didſt firſt come and ſtir me up to come unto thee.</hi> And who ever magnified the freeneſs of the riches of the Grace of God like <hi>Paul?</hi> and why? Of all the men in
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:171186:134"/> the world, he lay under the greateſt preventions of Divine Love: no wonder therefore <hi>Paul</hi> of all men magnified the free Grace of God, for he of all other lay under the preventions of Divine Love.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Again further, God will ſo carry on the work of his Grace, and Mercy, that no fleſh may <hi>glory in it ſelf,</hi> that we may not reſt upon any thing that we <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>have,</hi> or <hi>ſuffer.</hi> When we are to come to duty, we are <hi>unwilling</hi> to it; after we have performed it, we are as apt to <hi>reſt</hi> upon it, as before we were unwilling to come unto it: what is the reaſon, but becauſe men think that they do come to God before God comes to them; but let a man be once fully convinced of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Love, and he <hi>reſts</hi> no more upon what he doth, but ſayes he then, if God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me in reference to my prayer, why ſhould I <hi>reſt</hi> on my prayer, if God hath prevented me in reference to my duty, why ſhould I <hi>reſt</hi> on my duty, ſayes <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, He calleth things that are not, that no fleſh may glory in his ſight,</hi> And in <hi>Job</hi> 33, ſayes <hi>Elihu</hi> there, <hi>In deep ſleep, in a dream, in a viſion of the night, when deep ſleep falleth upon men, in ſlumbrings upon the bed, then he openeth the ears of men, and ſealeth their inſtruction;</hi> Why? <hi>That he may withdraw man from his purpoſe, and hide pride from man.</hi> There is no ſuch way in the World to take down the pride of man, to keep him from <hi>reſting</hi> upon duty, as to be <hi>well ſeen, well expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced,</hi> in the preventing love of God: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God carries on the work of his Grace and Mercy in a way of preventing love, that no fleſh may glory in it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:171186:135"/>7. God will ſo carry on the work of his mercy and goodneſſe, and of his grace, that men may be made <hi>moſt gracious,</hi> and in caſe they ſin againſt him, they may be reduced to true repentance. What is there in all the World will make one ſo gracious as a <hi>ſight</hi> of Grace? and what gives one a <hi>greater ſight</hi> of Grace, then preventing love? And what is there in all the world that will reduce a ſoul to true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (having ſinned) like preventing love? It is ſaid of <hi>Peter,</hi> he went out and wept bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>all his tears came out of the eyes of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace;</hi> Chriſt <hi>looked</hi> upon him firſt, it was preventing love that brought forth that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. I ſay, no ſuch way to reduce a poor ſoul that hath ſinned to true Repentance, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Gods preventing love. Do you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ask why God is pleaſed to carry on his mercy thus, in a way of preventing love; for theſe ſix or ſeven reaſons. And ſo you have the fourth thing.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>V.</hi> Well but then in the fifth place, What is there in this preventing love that is <hi>ſo ſweet</hi> to a gracious ſoul, to a thankful heart?</p>
               <p n="1">1. The more <hi>immediately</hi> that any mercy doth come out or Gods hand, and the <hi>leſs</hi> it runs through ours, the more ſweet it is. Water is ſweeteſt out of the Fountain. Now preventing mercy comes <hi>immediately</hi> out of the hands of God, and runs not through our hand at all, nor through the hand of the ſecond cauſe at all, therefore muſt needs be very ſweet.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, The more <hi>coſtleſs,</hi> or <hi>leſs coſtly to us,</hi> any mercy is, the ſweeter it is. Poſſibly a
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:171186:135"/> kindneſs may coſt more to keep it, then it is worth. Suppoſe a man promiſe me or give me wood; the cutting down of the wood, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it home, may coſt me more then the wood is worth: So a kindneſs may coſt one more care then the thing it ſelf doth amount unto. But now <hi>preventing mercy coſt me nothing,</hi> it is cut down to my hand, it is brought into my hand, it is <hi>coſtleſs mercy,</hi> it <hi>coſt me nothing,</hi> ſurely therefore it is very ſweet.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But then again Thirdly, The more <hi>perfect,</hi> and <hi>compleat,</hi> and <hi>entire</hi> any mercy is, the ſweeter it is. <hi>Half-mercies</hi> are not ſo ſweet as <hi>whole.</hi> Preventing mercy is compleat and entire. In the 16 of <hi>Ezek.</hi> you may ſee what a compleat mercy is there given, <hi>I waſhed thee with water</hi> (verſ. 9.) <hi>I throughly waſhed away thy Blood, and I annoynted thee with oyntment, I cloathed thee alſo with broy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered work, and ſhod thee with Badgers skin; and I girded thee about with fine linnen, and I covered thee with ſilk; I decked thee alſo with Ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thine hands, and a Chain on thy neck, and I put a Jewel on thy forehead, and ear-rings in thine eares; and a beautifull Crown upon thine head;</hi> and ſo he goes on. What mercy was this? It was preventing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee polluted in thy own blood, and ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, live, yea, I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy bloody, live.</hi> So then, preventing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is the moſt compleat mercy; and it muſt needs be ſo, for it comes immediately out of Gods hand, and not through the hand of the ſecond cauſe. That that comes <hi>immediately</hi> put
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:171186:136"/> of Gods hand, not running through the hand of the ſecond cauſe, is moſt compleat. Upon this account our <hi>Juſtification is more perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat then our Sanctification,</hi> becauſe it comes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately out of the hand of God, and not out of our own hand. In Juſtification our <hi>guilt</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, in Sanctification our <hi>filth</hi> is removed; our guilt is <hi>offenſive</hi> to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> our <hi>filth</hi> is <hi>offenſive to God:</hi> Now one would think, God ſhould rather take away all our <hi>filth</hi> that is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to himſelf, then all our <hi>guilt</hi> that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to us; no, but our Juſtification is <hi>perfect,</hi> our Sanctification <hi>not perfect;</hi> why? becauſe our Juſtification comes immediately out of the hand of God, and doth not run through our own hand; for though we be <hi>juſtified by our Faith,</hi> yet it is as Faith is <hi>Gods Inſtrument,</hi> not as <hi>our act:</hi> Now the more <hi>immediately</hi> that any mercy comes out of the hand of God, and the leſs out of our hand, the more <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>compleat</hi> it is: So doth preventing mercy do, and therefore muſt needs be very ſweet.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Again Fourthly, The more that any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy doth <hi>correct difficulty</hi> and <hi>ſweeten duty,</hi> the ſweeter is that mercy. Now preventing love doth <hi>correct difficulty,</hi> and it <hi>doth ſweeten duty:</hi> See it in <hi>Zacheus;</hi> what an hard and great work was he upon! <hi>Lord</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the half of my goods I give to the poor:</hi> Stay then, ſuppoſe his Eſtate was a thouſand pounds, he would have but five hundred pounds left; and Lord, ſayes he, <hi>If I have taken any thing from any man by falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, I reſtore him fourfold.</hi> Suppoſe he had wronged men to the value of a hundred pounds,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:171186:136"/> there's four hundred pounds more gone, ſo there's but a hundred pounds left of a thouſand: What an hard work is this! yet mark how eaſily he comes off to this hard work, <hi>Behold Lord:</hi> why he had drunk deep of preventing love, <hi>Zacheus come down,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>for to day I muſt abide at thine houſe.</hi> Chriſt doth not come and ſay, <hi>Zacheus,</hi> give half thy goods to the poor, and if thou haſt wronged any man, reſtore him fourfold, and then <hi>I</hi> will come to thy houſe; no, but <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus, Come down, for this day I muſt abide at thy houſe,</hi> preventing him with his love, and then this hard work comes off eaſily. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will <hi>correct difficulty</hi> and <hi>ſweeten duty</hi> more then <hi>preventing love,</hi> therefore preventing love muſt needs be ſweet. And thus now you ſee what there is in preventing love, that is ſo ſweet to a gracious ſoul. That is the Fifth.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But now Sixthly and Laſtly, You will ſay, Suppoſe I have taſted of preventing love and mercy, ſuppoſe I have had experience of it, for I muſt needs ſay, this is my caſe; for I was going on in the way of my ſin, and God prevented me many a time with his preventing Grace: I have been backward <hi>to,</hi> and dull <hi>in</hi> duty, and God hath many a time prevented me with <hi>aſſiſting Grace:</hi> I have been full of unbeleef, and ſaid, <hi>I am caſt off, and ſhall never ſee the face of God again,</hi> but the Lord hath prevented me with his <hi>comforting grace,</hi> and with the <hi>ſhines of his face:</hi> I was <hi>galloping</hi> to <hi>Hell</hi> as faſt as I could, but God hath prevented me with his <hi>ſaving Grace.</hi> And as for my outward Eſtate in the World, I was low, and knew not what to do, and God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:171186:137"/> me with ſuch a Gift, ſuch a Houſe and Land; what hath my life been but a <hi>Bundle of preventing mercy;</hi> if any have drunk deep of this preventing grace, I may ſay, I have <hi>much more.</hi> Now what is my Duty that doth flow from hence?</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you have taſted of Gods preventing love and mercy, if God hath indeed prevented you with the <hi>bleſſings of his goodneſs,</hi> why then ſhould not your hearts be filled with the ſenſe thereof? why ſhould not your thoughts be much thereupon? How God hath prevented you at ſuch a time, in ſuch a thing. The more <hi>ſenſe</hi> you have of Gods preventing love and mercy, the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly you will walk with God, and the more cloſely, eſpecially conſidering that God will not <hi>upbraid you.</hi> If a man takes a <hi>Beggar</hi> from the Dunghil, and makes her his Wife, prevents her with his love and kindneſs, the ſenſe of his preventing love, will make her walk humbly all her dayes, unleſs the man <hi>upbraid</hi> her with it; if he <hi>upbraids</hi> her with it, it will not make her walk humbly; but unleſs he <hi>upbraids</hi> her with it, the ſenſe of it will make her walk humbly all her dayes. Friends, God doth prevent us with his love, <hi>and will not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid us with his preventions;</hi> and therefore why ſhould we not walk humbly, and why ſhould we not think much thereon, and have our hearts <hi>filled</hi> with the <hi>ſenſe</hi> thereof. The more <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> and <hi>uſeful</hi> any mercy is, the more we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to think thereon. Some mercies are <hi>more neceſſary,</hi> and ſome <hi>leſs neceſſary.</hi> Thoſe mercies and bleſſings we put God upon the giving of with our <hi>own deſires,</hi> we may <hi>ſuſpect</hi> are <hi>leſs neceſſary;</hi>
                  <pb n="497" facs="tcp:171186:137"/> but thoſe that God <hi>gives</hi> us in a way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting love, we may think them <hi>moſt neceſſary.</hi> This is the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y of preventing love, ſurely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are ingaged to think much thereon; thus ye become Gods <hi>Darlings</hi> by his prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love. The World hath its Darlings: ſuch a one lyes long in bed, takes little pains, yet the World flows in upon him, the World prevents him, he is the <hi>Worlds Darling;</hi> another man is up early and late, takes a great deal of pains, and yet is <hi>Poor;</hi> but here's a man, do what he will, yet he <hi>grows Rich,</hi> for he is the <hi>Worlds Darling:</hi> So now you have bleſſing upon bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and in a way of prevention, What doth this argue, but that you are <hi>Gods Darlings?</hi> And will you not think much of this? O think much thereon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you have taſted of this preventing love and mercy, go away and be <hi>very thankfull</hi> to God upon this account. Shall <hi>David</hi> be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Lord for preventing him, taking him from the <hi>Sheep-fold,</hi> and will not you be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for preventing mercy? Shall <hi>Ruth</hi> be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to <hi>Boaz</hi> for preventing her with his <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> ſpreading his skirt over her, and will not you be thankfull to the Lord for his preventing love to you? Why ſhould ye not all ſay with <hi>David</hi> here, <hi>He hath prevented me with the bleſſings of his goodneſs.</hi> Indeed I was a great ſinner, but he hath prevented me with his <hi>Juſtifying Mercy;</hi> and I was a wandring creature, as a loſt ſheep, but he hath prevented me with his <hi>Redeeming Mercy;</hi> Gpd ſpake once, and twice unto me, and I heard
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:171186:138"/> it not, but in the <hi>deep ſleep</hi> of my ſoul, then did he <hi>open mine ears,</hi> and <hi>ſeal inſtruction</hi> on me before I was aware; therefore <hi>all that is within me bleſſe the Lord.</hi> O you that are thus prevented, bleſſe the Lord for this his preventing mercy, his ſweet mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But thirdly, If you have taſted of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting mercy, and have indeed been prevented with the bleſſings of his goodneſs, even your ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prayers have been prevented with the bleſſings of his goodneſs; Why then ſhould ye not be <hi>early up,</hi> and <hi>ſooner at your prayers,</hi> that if it may be, you may prevent Gods mercy with your prayers, as God hath prevented your prayers with his mercy. When a Maſter comes into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where his Servant lyes, and finds him in bed, what ſayes the Servant, if he be <hi>ingenious?</hi> This my Maſters coming into my bed-chamber before I was up, is a <hi>plain rebuke to my ſloth,</hi> I will be up the <hi>ſooner hereafter.</hi> So ſayes a gracious inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ſoul, Gods preventing my prayer with his mercy, is a <hi>plaine rebuke to my prayer;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>awake prayer, up prayer,</hi> through the grace of God I will never be ſo tardy again with my Prayer, and Duty; but as God hath prevented my prayer with his mercy, ſo through grace, I will prevent his mercy with my prayer for the time to come.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you have taſted of Gods preventing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and God hath indeed prevented you with the bleſſings of his goodneſs, why then ſhould ye not all labour to be <hi>like unto God in your deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with men,</hi> preventing them with your lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:171186:138"/> kindneſs. You think it a great matter to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give a man that hath injured you, upon <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of his fault;</hi> but God prevents us with his forgiveneſs, <hi>before we acknowledge,</hi> and be humbled; therefore why ſhould you not labour to be like to God therein? If a man hath done you a wrong, or injury, do not ſtand upon it to have his acknowledgement, but ſay, <hi>I will be like to God,</hi> God prevents me with his love before my acknowledgement, therefore through Grace I will prevent this man with my kindneſs before his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, I will forgive him. Thus labour to be like unto God in all your dealings with men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But Fifthly and Laſtly, If you have taſted of this preventing love, and God hath indeed prevented you with the bleſſings of his goodneſs, why then, why ſhould ye not <hi>truſt in the Lord for ever?</hi> Whatſoever your condition be, <hi>truſt in the Lord, and believe for ever now,</hi> for your ſouls, for your bodies. Some there are that doubt of their Salvation, of the ſalvation of their Souls: Ah, ſayes one, I am afraid I ſhall not be ſaved, becauſe my prayer cannot be accepted; <hi>But will the Lord be found of thoſe that ſeek him not, and will he not be found of you that ſeek him?</hi> Though your prayers are poor prayers. Ah ſayes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I am afraid the Lord will not receive me when I come to him, he will not receive me, No, <hi>But if the Lord comes to us firſt, and makes a tender and offer of his Grace to us,</hi> if he ſeeks us, will he not receive them (think you) that ſeek him? <hi>Surely he will.</hi> Some there are that doubt
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:171186:139"/> in reference to their outward condition, and ſay, they ſhall want Proviſion, ſhall want Eſtates to maintain them; but hath the Lord prevented you with his mercy in the <hi>great turns</hi> of your life, why then ſhould you not <hi>truſt in the Lord</hi> though you <hi>ſee no means</hi> at all how you ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed? Heretofore God hath prevented you with his mercies; and why ſhould you not ſay, God hath prevented me heretofore, therefore <hi>now I'le truſt</hi> in him, though I ſee no means of ſupply? Whatſoever your condition be, truſt in the Lord now upon this account, and <hi>believe, believe.</hi> Let me ſay this to you, <hi>Would you believe?</hi> Do you <hi>deſire to believe?</hi> Yes, I deſire to believe; do ye? Then let your eye be <hi>fixed</hi> upon Gods prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love. What is the reaſon that men do not believe, but becauſe their eyes are <hi>fixed no more ſtedily</hi> upon preventing love? The more you know God is willing to help you, the more you will believe; I believe that, you will ſay. Now I pray then tell me, Suppoſe a man comes to a <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> and <hi>before the Beggar asks,</hi> the man gives him money; will not the Beggar conclude that this man was <hi>willing to relieve him?</hi> Yes. Thus now it is, <hi>we beg</hi> and <hi>we beg,</hi> but it is <hi>as no beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,</hi> then comes the Lord and prevents us with his mercy; will you not ſay, the Lord is willing to ſhew mercy? Surely he is: Now therefore, ſeeing God is thus willing to ſhew mercy, O then believe you that have gone <hi>doubting,</hi> and <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>trembling</hi> all your dayes, for ſhame now believe. Have you <hi>taſted</hi> of Gods preventing mercy <hi>time</hi> after <hi>time,</hi> in the matter of your <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi>
                  <pb n="501" facs="tcp:171186:139"/> in the matter of your <hi>Sanctification,</hi> in the matter of your <hi>Conſolation,</hi> and in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to your outward Concernments? O truſt in the Lord for ever upon this account, and <hi>magnifie the freeneſs</hi> of his Grace. Now go away, and ſay, through free Grace, <hi>I'le doubt no more:</hi> Upon all occaſions truſt in the Lord, O you that have been made partakers of preventing mercy.</p>
